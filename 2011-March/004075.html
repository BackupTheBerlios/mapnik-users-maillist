<PRE>Nick,
This has been on my list of things to do for a while too, but like many of
my project ideas, it didn't get that far!
I do not have any experience of the OS contour files - I coudn't work out
how to convert the dxf's into something more useable by mapnik (I quite
fancied getting them into postgresql like I did with srtm data).  I think
the OS height data comes as a DEM as well as a DXF so it should be possible
to process it like SRTM?

I did have a similar issue with rendering the Vector Map District data
though, which comes as lots of shapefiles.  I tried it two different ways:

   1. Render each shapefile individually using mapnik, by writing a python
   script to add a different mapnik layer for each shapefile - this worked fine
   for a single grid square (e.g. NZ), but it keeled over when I tried to do it
   for the whole UK - ran out of memory I think.
   2. Pull the shapefiles into a postgresql database and render it just like
   OSM data - lines and points worked fine, but I had trouble with polygons -
   lots of errors about invalid geometry.  This was a shame because the big
   thing I like about VMD is the area data.   It looked as though the problem
   was areas intersecting themselves, but I never worked out how to fix it - I
   suspect that it may be rounding errors and I should have used the shp2pgsql
   option to just use integers, but I think I must have got bored before I
   tried re-importing the entire database again.

I made some notes as I went along, which you should be able to see
here&lt;<A HREF="http://nerdytoad.blogspot.com/search/label/OrdnanceSurvey">http://nerdytoad.blogspot.com/search/label/OrdnanceSurvey</A>&gt;.
 The scripts I wrote and mapnik stylesheets are in a public archive, which
should be referenced in my notes.

I suspect that you will have a similar problem with the contour shapefiles
as I had with the VMD ones, so I would be inclined to go for the database
option, or at least treat that as a contingency plan.

I would like to see this idea working, so if you would like any help, please
let me know.

Regards


Graham.
