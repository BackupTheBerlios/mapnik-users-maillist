<PRE>I went ahead and processed my blocks shapefile with a Python/OGR
script (attached, maybe it'll be useful to someone else), which
&quot;reduced&quot; down the blocks into streets, based on common fields (like
street name). This worked well, in that the street features render as
expected, and if I load up the shapefile in a desktop GIS app I can
confirm that the streets are now longer features.

However, I'm now getting some odd behavior in the label placement. See here:

<A HREF="https://trac.mapnik.org/attachment/ticket/13/strange-placement.png">https://trac.mapnik.org/attachment/ticket/13/strange-placement.png</A>

(The streets in question are highlighted in red, arterial streets).

As you can see, &quot;N Milwaukee Ave&quot; is way off the line in one case, and
slightly off in the other. If I play with &quot;minimum_distance&quot; and
&quot;spacing&quot; in the XML file, they move around a bit but never line up
neatly along the street. &quot;W Diversey Ave&quot; is fine, and adjusting those
same two parameters doesn't seem to affect it. Then there's &quot;N Elston
Ave&quot;, which is another diagonal street but isn't within the extent of
this tile and so shouldn't be labeled at all.

I have some suspicions: in my reduction script, I created new
geometries of type &quot;MULTILINESTRING&quot; as a collection of the
&quot;LINESTRING&quot;s which represented the blocks. It seems that OGR will
convert a MULTILINESTRING to a LINESTRING if there is only one
LINESTRING in its collection when it serializes out to the data
source. (I confirmed this by printing out the geometry types for each
of the new features.) Milwaukee Ave and Elston Ave both are mostly
straight but have an angle to them about halfway along their
respective routes in the city, like a dogleg. Is it possible that
Mapnik is confused about what type of geometry it is dealing with?
This might explain why Diversey is labeled with correct placement:
it's an almost perfectly straight line from beginning to end.

Pondering,

-Paul
