</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to plot OS Mastermap data using Mapnik, and am having a bit of trouble with the placement of the cartographic labels.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather than having the labels sourced from shape attributes, the dataset defines all label text as separate features with:
</I>&gt;<i> - a point location
</I>&gt;<i> - the anchor location of the text relative to the point (i.e. Top left, Middle bottom etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> - the angle at which the text should be oriented (rather curiously, measured as an integer value in 10ths of a degree from 0 - 3599)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> If I use a TextSymbolizer with placement=point, then I can place the labels at the correct position relative to the point using a combination of the vertical_alignment and dx/dy properties, but there doesn't seem to be any way to specify the angle at which the text should be drawn. (i.e. there's no equivalent to MapServer's ANGLE property)
</I>
Mapnik2/trunk does support angles, and reading them from a database field. So, this will be available in the next release.

Also Hermann Krauses recent work, also just in the trunk development code, has support for anchors: <A HREF="http://mapnik.org/news/2011/jul/13/new_text_placement_system/">http://mapnik.org/news/2011/jul/13/new_text_placement_system/</A>

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> So, instead, I've been applying some old-school trigonmetry to artificially create lines at the appropriate angle, either starting or ending at the anchor point in question, and drawing the text on the line using a TextSymbolizer with the placement=line model instead. It's a lot slower, since it's probably invoking lots of clever &quot;wrapping text to wiggly lines&quot; computations that aren't required for my single line segment scenario, but it does (nearly) get the results I want.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem I now have is that, by using the placement=line model, I appear to have sacrificed the ability to specify whereabouts along the line the label gets placed - there is no horizontal-alignment attribute when using a TextSymbolizer on a line as far as I can tell - the label is always placed in the centre of the line.
</I>
Yes, unfortunately horizontal-alignment is not yet implemented for line placement.

&gt;<i> That means the only way I can get the label drawn in the right place is if I create the line to be exactly of the right length for the label to fit. If I create it too big, the label is effectively &quot;padded&quot; away from its anchor point (which lies at one end of the line) and misplaced. But, if I create the line too small, the TextSymbolizer label attached to it won't be rendered at all. The problem is that, seeing as I'm using a non-fixed width font, the length of the text string (and therefore the offset) is different for every individual label - I've tried computing an approximate line length per length of label, but it's not reliable enough to be used.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Does anybody have any smart workarounds (or perhaps, a magical text-angle property that I'm unaware of!) as to how to create angled text anchored to a point?
</I>
See above! :)

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
