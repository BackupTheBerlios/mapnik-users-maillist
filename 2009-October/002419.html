This reminds me of a performance problem I had yesterday with a big
(&gt;4Gb) vector dataset I stored in postgres. The problem turned out to be
that the spatial index on the geometry column was not being used because
the query planner thought that a sequential scan would be faster (due to
the relatively small number of total rows but very large geometries).
Since the spatial predicate had to be evaluated on *every* geometry the
database was doing much more work than it needed.

This problem is described in here [1] (section 5.1) and one of the
proposed workarounds fixed it for me: Create a another geometry column
to store the pre-calculated envelope of each geometry, create an index
on that and, optionally, CLUSTER the table on that index. You should
then first filter out all non-overlapping rows using this index (which
is very fast) before operating on the real geometry column (on a,
hopefully, much reduced recordset)

I'm not sure if Mapnik can be configured to filter on a geometry column
different than the one that it is rendering (haven't got there yet) but
you could &quot;split up&quot; the table into several views (one for each region)
using this index internally and then configure each one as an individual
datasource using the &quot;real&quot; geometry column. Alternatively you could
configure each Mapnik layer using a sub-select that does the filtering,
explained here [2].

Hope it helps,

Alberto
