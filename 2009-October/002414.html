If you are rendering maps with lots of details then ~20 seconds seems a
reasonable rendering time.

&gt;<i>  But the thing which makes me surprise is when i am

What you might find is that the country borders themselves are very slow
to render. They are often highly detailed and contain lots of data.
Rendering more of them may slow things down. You can speed things up by
simplifying the data. This can be done by using the postgis simplify()
function to create a new set of boundaries which are used for high zoom
levels. Then you can switch to the original more detailed boundaries at
low zooms.


&gt;<i> Again, could you please explain me in more details about how to merge static
</I>&gt;<i> map image tiles with dynamic map image containing route planning
</I>&gt;<i> information?
</I>
That depends entirely on your application. If the tiles are displayed in
a web browser then people often use javascript in the client side
browser to add the overlay. Several good examples of this can be found
on the OpenLayers website <A HREF="http://gallery.openlayers.org/">http://gallery.openlayers.org/</A>

If you are using another application framework then you will probably
have APIs letting you load a bitmap into a window and then draw points,
icons &amp; lines over the top.
