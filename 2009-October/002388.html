<PRE>Hi Adam,

&gt;<i> I've been generating hillshade images using the SRTM3 data, these are 
</I>&gt;<i> looking good but I've noticed some artifacts around the area of the 
</I>&gt;<i> Southern Alps of New Zealand.  These can be seen in this sample image: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://test.geosmart.co.nz/images/relief-artifacts.png">http://test.geosmart.co.nz/images/relief-artifacts.png</A>
</I>
I noticed some improvements when leaving out the -dstnodata option, but of 
course there are still artefacts left (only some hole-filling could remove 
that, more or less plausibly, and I do not know of any automatic way to 
achieve that). So for small artefacts, this seems to work rather well, while 
for larger ones, they seem to be still pretty well visible.

In the Alps (New Zealand or Europe ...) there will probably still be another 
issue making this worse: I experimented with leaving out the mentioned 
option for generating hill shadings and reliefs; when looking at the 
generated reliefs, it seems like now the missing parts are filled with the 
color for the lowest configured elevation (for me eg. dark green instead of 
black); this is an improvement (in my eyes), but if dark green spots appear 
in the grey or white of high mountains, then that of course still is pretty 
striking. As said, I think the only way around that is using filling for 
voids, or using preprocessed data, eg. CIAT/CSI/CGIAR, mentioned on the 
HikingBikingMaps wiki page. These currently have licensing issues because 
they are non-commercial only; but with the possible move to ODbL in the 
future, and the possibility to license products other than CC-BY-SA (in my 
understanding) this can be resolved, if non-commercial use is sufficient for 
you (otherwise you might have to negotiate for other licenses or datasets).

&gt;<i> and how to remove them in the processing of the data.  So far I've 
</I>&gt;<i> experimented with some of the options to gdalwarp, on the Hiking/Biking 
</I>&gt;<i> maps wiki page it was suggested to pass &quot;-wt Float32 -ot Float32&quot; to the
</I>
These I introduced, because I was generating maps for rather small areas 
with a high level of details. When doing interpolation of DEM data for 
these, I noticed steps instead of smooth elevation transitions, which arose 
because of the limited elevation resolution of the default int values. For 
large areas, you might want to leave them out as any effects will probably 
not be noticeable, and the size of the files is multiplied, such that any 
memory limits will be hit earlier that without the floats.

Yours, Holger
