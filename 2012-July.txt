Hello

I am very new at rendering maps.
My problem is with an overlay I'm trying to render.
This style works as I expect it (only rendering red tracks):
<Style name="running">
    <Rule>
      &maxscale_zoom1;
      &minscale_zoom10;
      <PointSymbolizer file="&symbols;/Running_Man-32x32.png"
allow-overlap="false" ignore-placement="false"/>
    </Rule>
    <Rule>
        <Filter>[colour] = '#FF0000'</Filter>
        &maxscale_zoom11;
        &minscale_zoom19;
        <LineSymbolizer stroke="#FF0000" stroke-width="3"/>
    </Rule>
</Style>

As you might have guessed I want to render all tracks in the color of
[colour]. Since I didn't find any way to put in this variable in this
syntax I tried this syntax:
<Style name="running">
    <Rule>
      &maxscale_zoom1;
      &minscale_zoom10;
      <PointSymbolizer file="&symbols;/Running_Man-32x32.png"
allow-overlap="false" ignore-placement="false"/>
    </Rule>
    <Rule>
        &maxscale_zoom11;
        &minscale_zoom19;
        <LineSymbolizer>
                                <CssParameter
name="stroke">#FF0000</CssParameter>
                                <CssParameter
name="stroke-width">3</CssParameter>
        </LineSymbolizer>
    </Rule>
</Style>

But that does not render as I think (all tracks in blue) but instead
all tracks as black with a width of 1 (default values)? My thinking
was to get this to work and then replace the #FF0000 with [colour] to
render as I want it to. Anyone knows if I can and/or how I can get
this to work?
(I have tried searching on google and in osm, but not found anything
(maybee I have used wrong searchstring))

Best Regards Tobias
