<PRE>Apologies, I have not paid much attention to this mailing list in the past...

The problem, you are reporting
  and if I try to run the python demo:

  /usr/local/src/mapnik/demo/python $ python rundemo.py
  /usr/local/lib/mapnik/input/postgis.so: undefined symbol:
  _ZN5boost5mutexC1Ev
  registered datasource : raster
  registered datasource : shape
  scale=376.547
  start map processing bbox=Envelope(1.40512e+06,-249015,1.70636e+06,-23087.2)
  python: symbol lookup error: /usr/local/lib/mapnik/input/shape.so:
  undefined symbol: _ZN6mapnik8EnvelopeIdEC1Ev

is known in the C++ world as a 'name-mangling issue'.

I do not want to get too technical, but a tiny bit of explanation will help to sort this out. In the C++ world, a different functions can have the same name, but different parameters. In order to find the right function at runtime, the compiler generates much longer names that are in 99% of cases only visible to the machine -- unless something wrong happens as in your case. 

Your python program essentially look for a function that it cannot find in the library it has loaded at runtime. However, when the program was built (that is compiled and linked) it was all ok, otherwise the linker would have complained at that point.

So what happens in your situation is that at runtime you load a different library from the one you linked against. The ldd command gives you the list of libraries loaded at runtime. 

I would think that you have some kind of old library hanging around that causes the trouble. If you can make sure you only have one boost installation and build everything from scratch, also maybe take out the tinkering with the boost library name (I remember reading you doing something like this in this thread, apologies if this is not the case, I did something first trying to sort out my problems, but it was a red herring). 

I had similar trouble when I first built mapnik, I managed to sort it out without fully getting to the bottom of this issue. But my feeling was that the Scones built environment (which I am not familiar with) does not control effectively enough the order of libraries and library path when linking. E.g if you have a boost installation in /usr/local and one in /usr/ in might pick up the /usr/ one even if you specify to use the /usr/local boost installation. So it links against the boost libaries in /usr/lib, while at runtime the /usr/local/ shared libraries are picked up.

I had thought this was just me, but there seems to be something lurking...
