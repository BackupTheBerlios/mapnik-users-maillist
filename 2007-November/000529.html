<PRE>Hi

I've been happily using the python bindings of mapnik for creating a few
dynamically generated maps (some of the styling comes from a database
etc.)

I also wanted to do some simple querying of the features in the shape
files I was using to generate the map. I initially thought mapnik would
have the functionality i needed in a nice python api. However it seems
the python bindings are limited to expose just the map styling parts of
the c++ code base. 

For example I wanted to to find some particular countries in a shape
file and then get the bounds of their individual geometries. So i hoped
I could get a mapnik.FeatureSet from a mapnik.Datasource using a
mapnik.Filter and then get a mapnik.Envelope for each of the features.

I couldn't see a way to do this with mapnik python but the code seems to
be there in the c++. Unfortunately as its c++ i couldn't get at it with
ctypes.

It seems a shame this sort of functionality isn't exposed in the mapnik
python bindings. Have I missed the way to do it? Is this
possible/desirable in the future? Could anyone recommend another python
library for this sort of thing.

thanks,
Graham
