<PRE>I have a mapnik mapfile that has an srs of 900913 for all the source layers
and also 900913 at the top within the Map tag.
My main application will be requesting layers as 900913 which will work
fine, but I have a legacy application which I will eventually convert to
requesting layers as 900913 but for now will request as 4326.
Is their a way that I can have this mapfile accept requests for srs values
of both 900913 (native projection) and 4326 (reprojection on the fly).
Is it as simple as having the legacy application WMS request layers as
srs=4326?

John
