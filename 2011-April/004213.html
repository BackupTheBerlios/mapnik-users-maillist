<PRE>Hi Dane,

I am keen to have something that is easy to maintain, so wanted to preserve
the file structure of the original, and I want to use the mapnik2 scale
factor work that Carlos did for last year's GSoC, so I am looking for a true
mapnik2 style file.   I was starting to think about building a style myself
from the bottom up....

Therefore, I think that producing a mapnik2 OSM style would be really good,
but I wonder if just writing it in XML is the best way?

I would like to have a style file (or rather files) that is easy to maintain
to encourage people to customise it.   Even the 'new' OSM style using
entities is quite a daunting thing to modify - adding or deleting a feature
is quite hard to fathom.

I was playing with the carto 'CSS' stylesheet generator last night and was
very impressed with it (especially when coupled with the tilemill front-end
to visualise your changes in real time, so I wonder if this might be a
better way to go (I am not sure what the real difference is between carto
and cascadenik from a users point of view - I had a go at carto first
because it seems to be being more actively developed, but I would go with
either).   Tilemill would be a big selling point for carto though,
especially when support for postgresql databases is added.

I think it would be worth putting some up-front effort into agreeing the
design of the file structure (and documenting it!), to help with usability -
I would like to make sure we separate the SQL bits from the style bits, both
from a security and an ease of understanding perspective.

I would be interested in people's thoughts about pure XML or a CSS version.
  I am not sure who maintains the current OSM style?   They are bound to
have ideas about this too.

Regards


Graham.
