<PRE>Hi guys&#65292;
       I am Xiao from China. Currently, I am a graduate student from Peking
University and I have a proposal about developing an online stylesheet
editor for mapnik. I am looking forward to get some feedback from your guys.
And suggestions are welcome. Since this is the first time I apply for GSOC
and for mapnik, there are may be many problems with my proposal. So please
help me figure it out. Really appreciate your kind help :) Following is my
proposal:

Name:

Xiao Cai



Country:

China



School and degree:

Peking University, master program



Email:

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-users">pku.xiao at gmail.com</A>



Phone:

86-15210006700



OSGeo project(s):

mapnik



Title:

(please include the name of the member project as part of the title, for
example: &quot;Gee Whiz Foobar 2001 for QGIS&quot;)

A web based GUI for mapnik symbol composer??

better inteaction ways



Describe your idea

  1. Introduction

I would like to implement a web based WYSIWYG stylesheet editor for mapnik.
It should support the visualization of all the symbolizers of mapnik and
provide a easy to use user interface.



  2. Background

Actually, there is a stylesheet editor for mapnik already. It is developed
by cloudmade(<A HREF="http://maps.cloudmade.com/editor#">http://maps.cloudmade.com/editor#</A>)

However, it is not open source and  I think an open source substitution is
necessary for the OSGeo community.



  3. The idea

The basic idea is to implement a simple web app with following features:

   1. upload a stylesheet file and render a sample area with the stylesheet
   2. provide some widgets for editing  the stylesheet
   3. WYSIWYG feedback


   1. Color picker for styles



  4. Project plan (how do you plan to spend your summer?)

   1. familiar with how mapnik works ( the architecture, APIs, the symbology
   documentation) (one or two weeks)
   2. clearly define the features are going to develop in the summer and
   pulish it as a wiki page or blog and request review by mentor and the whole
   OSGeo community  (one week)


   1. develop the first prototype of the web app ( two weeks)


   1. get feedback and do some refortoring&#65288;one week)


   1. final refinement( the rest of the time)



  5. Future ideas / How can your idea be expanded?

There are a lot of points we could expand for the online style sheet editor.
We may provide some social features for the style sheet editor such as
rating, comment, collaboratively edit and so on.



Explain how your SoC task would benefit the OSGeo member project and more
generally the OSGeo Foundation as a whole:

An open source online WYSIWYG editor is really helpful for those who are not
from programming background. It would inlarge the community and make using
mapnik much easier.



Please provide details of general computing experience:

 (operating systems you use on a day-to-day basis, languages you could write
a program in, hardware, networking experience, etc.)

Operating System:

Usually work on windows with cygwin, also maintain two linux server for my
lab

Enjoy mac in spare time on my own laptop.

Familiar programming language:

Python, Csharp &gt; 20000 lines

C/C++, JavaScript &gt; 10000 lines

SQL, Shell Script &gt; 1000 lines

Familiar with django and dojo framework



Please provide details of previous GIS experience:

I've implemented  web gis system for my unversity. In the system, we use
mapserver for the map render. And django and dojo for rapid web development.




I've developed several small  qgis plugin for image segmentations.



Please provide details of any previous involvement with GIS programming and
other software programming:

I've implemented a js graph library similar to RaphaelJS in MSRA(Microsoft
Research Asia) as a browser visualization library.

It is a solo project and I've been in charge of the design, develop and
document by myself.



I've been involved in a project which is aimed to develop a virtual training
system for firefighters. I've implemented a database layer for the business
logic and also a desktop client as a controller of the training information
management.



Please tell us why you are interested in GIS and open source software:

FOSS is great. I am a strong advocate of FOSS. I think it is very
importatnt.



Please tell us why you are interested in working for OSGeo and the software
project you have selected:

Since in my daily work, I used a lot of OSGeo software, such as QGIS and
GDAL. I think it would be great to do something for the community.



Please tell us why you are interested in your specific coding project:

A beatuiful map always makes one happy. So I think mapnik is a great
project. And I want to make making a beatuiful map easier with better tools.



Would your application contribute to your ongoing studies/degree? If so,
how?

Sure it is. Since I think it would help me understand more about the
underlying mechinism of map rendering which is very important for



*Please explain how you intend to continue being an active member of your
project and/or OSGeo AFTER the summer is over:*

I think I could maintain the stylesheet editor code base and add new
features according to the users' feedback. If possible, I would like to join
some other OSGeo projects as well.



*Do you understand this is a serious commitment, equivalent to a full-time
paid summer internship or summer job?*

Sure I understand that it is very serious. And I am really interested in the
project and would like to devote my summer time into this activity.

-- 
Love life!
