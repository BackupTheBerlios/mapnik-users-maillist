<PRE>Hey all,

I'm a GSoC student applicant that proposed to carry out the Cartographic
Elements idea on the ideas page. I've been devoting my time into researching
how I can contribute to your project. Rob asks me about how my idea would
improve/integrate/build-on the mapnik.printing. I spent some time on it and
have a couple of questions.

Questions

   - When printing.py scales the map to fit the page, does it fit to page
   width/height (in which case does it cut off a section of the map or does it
   leave a blank space on one side?) or does it stretch the mapnik layer to fit
   the paper (which throws off accuracy)?
   - Does mapnik have any plans to produce topographic maps?

I plan to incorporate these additional features into my proposal. What do
you think?

   - I could create a patch for printing.py that covers more than just one
   mapnik map. How about layers of mapnik maps that are combined into an
   all-encompassing map that is legible. This idea may seem ambitious or hard,
   but for simple maps, this is possible. I could help combine mapnik maps and
   satellite images together as well.
   - What sorts of map projections does mapnik support? Does the accuracy of
   printing.py cover them all? I could cover many types of maps in addition to
   thematic maps and deliver a patch for printing.py
   - For the additional cartographic elements, how about adding data to the
   map? Calculating anything from population density to number of sports
   facilities in an area could be a bonus for mapnik. I plan to load data to
   mapnik for calculating statistics, importing it into printing.py and
   rendering a box for these statistics in an open space on the map.
   - Does the mapnik map in printing.py already have things like street
   names, titles, labels, compass, credits, metadata (index)? If those aspects
   are missing, I could add them.
   - It would also be nice to add an additional feature for printing.py for
   a custom object (maybe a start to destination route?) to be added to the map
   and fit in available space. How about custom borders and lines? I can
   implement custom map design (color choosing) that allows the user to print
   maps while choosing colors for water bodies, land, streets, landmarks.
   - I like the scaling accuracy in this printing.py. I certainly learned a
   lot just reading it and researching on Wikipedia. Is the scaling accuracy up
   to your expectations? If not, I can help make it better.
   - Does the mapnik account for inset maps? If not, I could add that as an
   additional layer for printing.py.

If I mentioned something that is already done, please let me know, so I can
find something else to contribute to your organization.
Thanks for your time! :D

Regards,
Bryan
