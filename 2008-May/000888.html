<PRE>Hello Collin,

There's kind of a lot buried in your question. I'm also new to Mapnik,  
but I've had a lot of experience dealing with maps as a consumer for  
our Modest Maps project. A lot of my current work in tile generation  
is tuned specifically for consumption by that particular Flash-based  
library.

Some short answers: generating tiles is just like generating lots of  
small images, each one covering a small square area of your projected  
world. Because there are *so many* tiles in an extensive map, it  
usually makes sense to use a caching layer and generate only those  
tiles that you need, at whatever zoom level is requested by your user.  
I'm not sure what books would be available on a topic as green as this  
one, but I did recently order Krygier's Making Maps out of curiosity  
(it hasn't shipped yet):
	<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593852002">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593852002</A>

Mapnik has a &quot;render_tile_to_file()&quot; that takes some extra parameters  
above and beyond &quot;render_to_file&quot; - seems relevant here, but I haven't  
been able to find a satisfactory explanation for how it works, so I'm  
ignoring it at the moment.

It helps to understand how a typical slippy map divides the world into  
x, y, and z coordinates. Google and MS both have short primers here:
	<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb259689.aspx</A>
	<A HREF="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/overlays.html#Google_Maps_Coordinates">http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/overlays.html#Google_Maps_Coordinates</A>

Once you start dealing with multiple zoom levels, you'll find that  
your style rules need minimum and maximum scale denominators, e.g.:
	&lt;MaxScaleDenominator&gt;100000&lt;/MaxScaleDenominator&gt;
	&lt;MinScaleDenominator&gt;50000&lt;/MinScaleDenominator&gt;

Numbers that seem to work for the projection above are:
	Zoom 1, min/max: 200000000 / 500000000
	Zoom 2, min/max: 100000000 / 200000000
	Zoom 3, min/max: 50000000 / 100000000
	Zoom 4, min/max: 25000000 / 50000000
	Zoom 5, min/max: 12500000 / 25000000
	Zoom 6, min/max: 6500000 / 12500000
	Zoom 7, min/max: 3000000 / 6500000
	Zoom 8, min/max: 1500000 / 3000000
	Zoom 9, min/max: 750000 / 1500000
	Zoom 10, min/max: 400000 / 750000
	Zoom 11, min/max: 200000 / 400000
	Zoom 12, min/max: 100000 / 200000
	Zoom 13, min/max: 50000 / 100000
	Zoom 14, min/max: 25000 / 50000
	Zoom 15, min/max: 12500 / 25000
	Zoom 16, min/max: 5000 / 12500
	Zoom 17, min/max: 2500 / 5000
	Zoom 18, min/max: 1000 / 2500

Paul Smith from Everyblock has an excellent high-level article on ALA  
that explains how Mapnik fits into a broader system for tile delivery:
	<A HREF="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/takecontrolofyourmaps">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/takecontrolofyourmaps</A>

FWIW, the decision to use OpenLayers and TileCache in Paul's write-up  
is definitely not set in stone. For a project I'm working on  
currently, I've written some of my own tile-rendering code in Python,  
and I'm serving up the imagery in a selection of Modest Maps and  
OpenLayers front ends. For the tile-rendering portion, I've been using  
a bunch of the helper classes from Modest Maps to handle coordinate  
systems and projections, specifically the Core.Coordinate class and  
Microsoft projection:
	<A HREF="http://modestmaps.mapstraction.com/trac/browser/trunk/py/ModestMaps">http://modestmaps.mapstraction.com/trac/browser/trunk/py/ModestMaps</A>

OpenLayers in particular takes a bit of wrangling to act like the  
Mercator projection used by Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and others. This  
projection looks like it's fast becoming a de facto standard for  
general web cartography. One way to get your OpenLayers map to behave  
properly is to feed these args to its constructor in a dictionary:

         maxExtent: new OpenLayers.Bounds(-20037508.3427892,  
-20037508.3427892, 20037508.3427892, 20037508.3427892),
         numZoomLevels: 18,
         maxResolution: 156543.0339,
         units: 'm',
         displayProjection:  new OpenLayers.Projection('EPSG:4326'),
         projection: 'EPSG:900913',
Something I'm handling at the moment is the need to overshoot your  
tile boundaries a bit when rendering, and ways to make that less of a  
hit. The general idea here is that if you have derived features that  
cross a tile boundary (for example, a really fat road whose centerline  
is on one tile, but whose width extends onto a second tile), you want  
to add some padding to your tiles to account for such features before  
cutting them back, otherwise the road will never show up on the second  
tile and your map will look wrong. OpenStreetMap renders their tiles  
in swaths of 8x8 with a 128 pixel padding to make this less of a  
performance hit, for example.

I hope this braindump is helpful, I'm elbows-deep in all of this right  
now, and when I come up for air in a week or two I'll try to write all  
of this up in an article of some kind. Paul and Dominic on this list  
have been wildly helpful with installation &amp; technical assistance.

-mike.
