<PRE>Kevin,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to create a map feature (say a polygon) that the color varies 
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the value of one its related data properties but it does 
</I>&gt;<i> so as a gradient not quantized increments. For example, I'm creating a 
</I>&gt;<i> map that shows patents/population for a given region and I've stored 
</I>&gt;<i> that value in the table along with the geometry. I'd then like to set 
</I>&gt;<i> up a range of colors say a gradient from red to blue that varies 
</I>&gt;<i> across that range of values in the patents/population field. It's very 
</I>&gt;<i> similar to what you've demonstrated in your CO2 map example on the 
</I>&gt;<i> website, but rather than having fixed steps the color varies across a 
</I>&gt;<i> spectrum as the data varies.
</I>Ok, it looks like you're after thematic maps after all:).  This would be 
quite straight forward to implement in client code. All you need to do 
is to create a style with N rules (steps) dynamically. Something like that:

1. query your database table for min/max value of that field.

2. calculate break points. The easiest would be so called equal counts
    step = (max - min)/num_steps , something like that.
3. create Rule for each break point and assign Symbolizer(s)
You will have to write a function to 'spread' colors. Let me know I can 
dig something up for you.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a fairly common feature in GIS software for visualizing data 
</I>&gt;<i> (I've used it in ArcGIS, etc) but I realize the underlying complexity 
</I>&gt;<i> involved. I was just curious if this kind of thing might be possible 
</I>&gt;<i> with the Mapnik architecture as it stands now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Shouldn't be a problem.
&gt;<i> Otherwise, how many filtered items are feasible? Assuming the gradient 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't possible I'd like to go ahead a quantize the data value (like in 
</I>&gt;<i> the CO2 example) but perhaps with a few more gradations.
</I>
As many as you like, but see above. You could automate all this based on 
'live' data.

Also consider pattern analysis if you have original point data.
There is some info at the link below:

</I>&gt;<i>     Kevin ,
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; One quick question I do have: is there an easy way to render colors
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; of  style as a gradient function of a data property in the GIS data?
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; For example, I'd like to make a gradient of colors based on a
</I>&gt;<i>     density
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; value and have it range between two colors. I realize that's a bit
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; tricky to implement but was wondering if there's a good strategy for
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; doing that sort of thing, aside from creating a set of filters
</I>&gt;<i>     like is
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; done in the Tutorial 2 example.
</I>&gt;<i>     No, creating filters for the big ranges won't be a good idea. I need
</I>&gt;<i>     some more info to understand what are you trying to achieve exactly.
</I>&gt;<i>     Have you got any screens?
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; If that's not possible, as it's designed now, does the symbolizer
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; render get access to the data related to the feature (such as
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; associated data fields in the DB)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Yep,it does.  What kind of geometries you're trying to symbolize?  If
</I>&gt;<i>     you  have a  bunch  of points , you could  write  a  specialized
</I>&gt;<i>     datasource/featureset  that would take vector data and create
</I>&gt;<i>     raster on
</I>&gt;<i>     fly (using your density algo)?? I have done something like that in the
</I>&gt;<i>     past.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Anyway, would be nice to have this functionality in Mapnik. Give me a
</I>&gt;<i>     bit more info and we'll figure something out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Cheers!
