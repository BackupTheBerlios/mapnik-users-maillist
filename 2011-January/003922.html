<PRE>Thanks Dane, some short replies inline:

&gt;<i> Are you wrapping mapnik in a C API or are you able to call directly to the C++?
</I>
Directly C++, imitating the mapnik C++ object model 1:1. The (php)
constructor calls new and each method fetches that pointer and calls
the equivalent C++ method. Quite straightforward really, on purpose,
for now. The only manual work is in implementing overloaded functions,
and call the right one depending on the amount and type of arguments.

&gt;&gt;<i> do you have thoughts on the relationship

</I>&gt;<i> Here are some bullet points:
</I>&lt;snip&gt;

Thanks, this is very much in line with my own thoughts, will try to
stick to this :)

&gt;&gt;<i> 1. as a separate project, e.g. on github (as an aside, is there any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talk of mapnik moving away from svn?
</I>&gt;<i> many of us are using git svn. there are not plans to move the central repository away from svn, partly because git svn works so well.
</I>&gt;<i> github or the like :)
</I>
Ok thanks, will do. I'm new to git so I didn't know about fancy things
like git/svn bridges but sounds interesting so am going to look into
it :)

&gt;<i> Well, you need both right? C++ docs won't help PHP or python programmers. If you are going to do api docs they really need to leverage the best of breed tools for each language.
</I>
Well to a certain extent documentation is language agnostic, I feel.
The easy and superficial things like types and names of arguments are
easy to extract from the source; maybe weakly typed languages need
some extra documentation if the purpose of a parameter isn't
immediately obvious, but for API documentation, imo, it's mostly the
higher-level information like preconditions, purpose of parameters
etc. that are useful. For example, to come back to the
datasource_cache example, what kind of paths are accepted? Only
absolute? Only filename? Relative? If relative, relative to what (does
the library guarantee that no chdir() is called, is it relative to
getcwd() or always relative to the calling binary? If one needs to
pass in a filename, is it only the basename or the full name including
extension? Is the extension fixed? (I know the answer to all these
things by now, it's just an example ;) ) All these things are the same
for C++, php or python bindings, since they all rely on one underlying
implementation.

Thinking about it, maybe I would even argue that the biggest part, and
certainly the most important part (the part that can't be extracted
from looking at the function/method declaration), is language agnostic
- not a very interesting debate I admit, but still it would give some
direction to the direction the documentation would go into. If there
are going to be 3 apis (c++, python, javascript) (or 4, if I get far
enough with the php ones ;) ), only the documentation of the types of
the arguments is going to be language-specific, plus maybe some extra
methods added to implement specific language idioms (wrap
getters/setters as member variables, arrays/vectors as iterators, ...)
It would be nice if everything that is not language specific could be
factored out into a common part. But let's worry about that when there
is a significant amount of such documentation ;)

In terms of documentation, I very much like MSDN. It's not perfect,
but for a set of documents of dozens of API's spanning the better part
of 2 decades, imo it's remarkably complete and accessible, and 90% of
the time provides all background required to use a call effectively
and easily (for example by directly linking background information
etc.). Compare this to the boost documentation, which usually contains
an OK introduction in tutorial form but whose api references are often
disguised as math proofs. boost::date_time is one such library
(although it has gotten much better in recent releases) that I
sometimes find impenetrable. I guess it's in the denseness: it assumes
that you know all the background by heart, and only gives you the most
canonical form of information. For a casual user or a new user with a
specific task to do, this is not nice to work with, at least I myself
don't find it so. I much prefer a form where one can arrive to a page
from google and learn fundamental concepts gradually if/when
necessary, rather than one where one needs to sit down for a day, read
all documentation and design considerations and only then can begin
use the library.

&gt;<i> Ya, thanks for offering. I think there is interest just a matter of getting ourself organized :)
</I>
OK, I don't want to impose myself, but just so you know that I'm
willing to help out, circumstances permitting.


cheers,

roel
