<PRE>Hi,
 
 I struggled with compiling on Debian Etch, but managed to get it working and thought I'd share what I found.

The problem seemed to be that my default install of Etch didn't include &quot;g++&quot;, or at least the version of g++ that mapnik required.  So simply:

apt-get install g++

and then at least compilation half worked.  I still had to do the manual relinking of the boost libraries as outlined in last months messages, but once all that was done then everything started working.

Scons error messages were pretty useless in figuring this out.

I'm not sure if Scons was dumping the error that g++ wasn't found to some log file somewhere that I wasn't aware of, but I had to figure out the problem by crawling through the source code of scons to find where the c++ source code it was trying to compile in order to test for the existance of the boost libraries was located, which turned out to be a hidden directory inside the scons directory (or one level below it, I can't remember now).  

The only error scons gave me was that it couldn't find the boost libraries, which were actually installed, and I had done the manual relinking hack.

Hopefully this helps someone somewhere. I'm pretty sure Debian Etch installs a different version of g++ (g++-3.3) than what mapnik expects, but perhaps this was just a problem with my installation.


Good Luck!
