<PRE>Hi,  I'm new to Mapnik and have finally gotten in compiled under Visual
Studio (2005).    I tried to get the latest svn release compiled but it
looks like there are still several issues prohibiting that.   The devs
are probably in the midst of changes, notably the changeover from iconv
to the Unicode library.     The current win32 binaries available don't
work because of the missing DLL export declaration for the
symbolizer_with_image class.  I see there's a trak entry for it but it's
still missing in the latest svn trunk.

Anyway, Mapnik looks to be a great resource and exactly what I'm looking
for although the lack of documentation makes it use rather daunting.
Even some basic intro info explaining the data model would be of great
use.  An explanation of the general flow of how data is added and
finally rendered along with descriptions of the function parameters for
the most common functions would be great.  Other then the demo program
there's nothing explaining how anything works.   It looks like doxygen
comments were started in map.hpp but even those are lacking.  For
instance the zoom functions mention a bounding box but there's no
explanation of what units the parameters should be in.  Are they in data
coordinates, pixels, etc?   One needs to look at the demo program in
order to guess at that.

I was hoping to get some clarification on how the input plugins work.
They are compiled as separate libraries (which I'm doing now), but I
don't see them linked in the demo program.   I'm specifically interested
in using GDAL - and it looks like the GDAL plugin only works with raster
formats.  No GDAL/OGR for vector formats yet?    Is it the parameter
&quot;type&quot; field that determines the proper input plugin to be called?    Is
there any input handled natively by Mapnik or strictly through plugins?
(it looks like without the plugins no input formats are supported).

I'm ultimately interested in making PDF output.   I spent a considerable
amount of time trying to get the experimental_pdf branch working but in
the end it was way too frustrating to get the dependencies all working
properly.    Now I see there's a cairo_renderer in the latest trunk - is
this to be a core part of mapnik in the next release?

Thanks for any answers anyone can provide!   Like I said it looks like
Mapnik has some very useful functionality but it's just a matter of
decoding it's capabilities!
