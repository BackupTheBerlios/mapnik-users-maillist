<PRE>Hi Tobias

I suspect that there are lots of cook-books out there that never quite get  
finished or published!
I too am finding that the scripts and utilities are changing all the time  
so that my recipes are out of date very quickly.

Yes, I realise that linux is, in a number of ways, preferred - but maybe as  
much as 95% of the OSM user base runs WIndows (from various unverified  
Internet estimates of domestic computer useage!). So, by making everything  
linux oriented, we immediately create barriers for a majority of potential  
users. This is clearly wider than just Mapnik, of course. I started out by  
cleaning off an older generation PC and installing Ubuntu and used that as  
a learning platform. As a non-linux user, it was a painful but rewarding  
process.

Regards,

Philip
