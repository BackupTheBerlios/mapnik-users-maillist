Hello,

I would like to know a bit more about &quot;space&quot; and &quot;minimum distance&quot; for
shield symbol.

If I got it right : 
- space defines the minimum distance between two occurrences of the same
shield. 
- minimum distance defines the minimum distance between any other labels.

But I think that &quot;space&quot; works only inside the same geometry.
At a low zoom level, this will give the expected behavior most of the time
but at a high zoom level, no matter you set a very high value to &quot;space&quot;
attribute, you will have a flood of shields ; close to each other.
I guess then that every single shield is placed on its own geometry and do
not take in account the fact that it is close to another shield which is on
another geometry.

If I am right, this shield flood can only be handled using &quot;minimum
distance&quot; and then its becomes hard to find a value that is far enough from
other shields and not too big at the same time (otherwise shield would be
considered as too close from other labels and then will not be rendered ...)

This also creates wrong behavior on highways. Those are often composed of 2
separated lines and then every line generates their own shields and those
don't respect the &quot;space&quot; value :-/

Could this be possible that shield would ''care about'' other shields even
when not placed on the same geometry ?

Thank you.
Nicolas.
