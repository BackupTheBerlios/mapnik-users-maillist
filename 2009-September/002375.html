<PRE>Hello,

since more than half a year I've been into mapnik rendering and as it  
is my first mail to the mapnik mailing list I want to thank all the  
developers and supporter for the great work they have done! It's  
really amazing what has been built up!

In the beginning I have rendered a small area and generate_tiles.py  
was enough for my needs. I uploaded the tiles on a normal apache  
server, and that was it.

But now, as I want to enlarge this map region and publish my maps not  
only for testing, I'm searching for a more sophisticated and more  
automatic solution with better performance. Therefore I was searching  
for a tile server and encountered tileCache as well as mod_tile, but I  
haven't figured out yet what the real differences between both  
solution are? Both of them provide caching and quick rendering.

As this topic was never discussed before in this mailing list, maybe  
it will also be of interest to other mapnik users.

Up to the present, tileCache seems to me more suitable: it's easier to  
install and better documented. Are there any disadvantages?

Kind regards and thank you for your answers,
Christoph Lingg
