<PRE>Hey Dane,
&gt;<i> So by interface to you mean a graphical admin panel/ web-based
</I>configuration page?Are you working on making the WMS parameters configurable
or the styling/rendering of a given layer configurable, or both?

Yep - we're making a web-based interface to the WMS parameters. There's a
bit of a summary at
<A HREF="http://www.developmentseed.org/blog/2008/oct/24/putting-anti-poverty-activists-map.">http://www.developmentseed.org/blog/2008/oct/24/putting-anti-poverty-activists-map.</A>
However, as far as actual data goes, it's been unfortunately another
stack
- we have very large CSV files which contain coordinates and bounding boxes
of tons of geographic features. Luckily, these match up with our shapefiles,
but it's no guarantee, and dealing with details (like boundaries changing
over time) will only be more of a headache. That's the big problem we're
dealing with - Drupal needs to know where things are in order to tell Mapnik
where to put it's bbox, and it would be nice for Drupal to ask the source
information of the map (PostGIS) rather than an arbitrary schema and funny
MySQL dumps.

&gt;<i> Yes I've used FeatureServer and it is awesome. FeatureServer with a
</I>PostGIS datasource is a fantastic way to interact with you geodata in a
restful way, allowing you to query and update data in postgis and therefore
modify dynamically the layers that mapnik is rendering.  As far as formal
WFS services GeoServer is also a great tool.

That's awesome. Are you using the GML output of FeatureServer? I've been
having some problems implementing a parser and some doubts about the
viability of GML in general vs. KML - KML seems to be gaining traction,
while GML is waiting on a new version and is lacking a schema to make it
valid (I asked on their mailing list:
<A HREF="http://featureserver.org/pipermail/featureserver/2008-October/000298.html">http://featureserver.org/pipermail/featureserver/2008-October/000298.html</A>
and haven't gotten any bites.)

&gt;<i> However, I'm not sure exactly what problem you are trying to solve.
</I>Clearly having the drupal server hosted on different machine than the mapnik
WMS will present some challenges in integration :)

The main reasoning behind having separate servers is that we'd like to have
a simple Drupal stack which we can hand off to clients and they'll be able
to deal with it, and have either hosted or distributed mapping instances
which we can continue to refine. It hasn't been that much of a pain so far -
it's actually kind of nice to be able to clone (via SliceHost) Mapnik
instances whenever memory or customization requires it.

It's great to know that someone else is doing this kind of stuff! And I
somewhat envy you, I do my side-project dreams in Django, and it's a
wonderful world :)
