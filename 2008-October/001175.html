<PRE>Hi,

I'm new to this list, because I wanted to report a minor issue, which 
has originally been reportet to osm-talk[0]. They pointed me to your 
mailing list.

I looked into the open defects and could not find anyhting similar to 
the issue I do report, but be gentle if the issue is known.

Here's the message I previously sent to osm-talk:
I just saw the name of a golf course in Salzburg, Austria [1] which 
shows a small (for Mapnik, but really big typographical) error. The dash 
in the name is drawn as the first sign in a line, which is really ugly.

It doesn't even make any sense to draw it like that, since the last line 
(the line with the dash) is the longest line, so there would have been 
enough space in the previous line for the dash, without increasing the 
size of the texts bounding box further than necessary.

Anyway, in my opinion the BB doesn't even matter, because the dash 
should *never* be the first sign in a line.

Don't get me wrong, it's only a minor issue, but it's really ugly, and 
if it would be easy to fix, I'd appreciate that. If it's not easy, it 
should be kept in mind, but I don't think such typographical errors are 
very often found on the map, so it wouldn't need a high priority.

cheers,
Norbert
