<PRE>Hi Dane,





&gt;<i>Hi Nick!
</I>





&gt;<i>However I have a couple of ideas for software using it and was wondering if there was more general interest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Firstly, I'm having quite significant memory issues attempting to run and maintain a PostGIS database containing OSM data for the UK on my Freemap server. 
</I>
&gt;<i>What kind of issues? It would be great to learn more about this. It seems like reading/parsing .osm files would take more memory that postgis, so I must be missing &gt;something.
</I>
Probably yes, but my point was more to allow users to easily generate mapnik tiles on their home computers from .osm extracts, avoiding the need to set up a database (as IMX setting up PostGIS can be a bit tricky, and due to differences in people's setups it doesn't always go exactly as specified in the instructions). The server issues I'm having are not due to mapnik, they're due to the import process (osm2pgsql) - even with the -s option turned on.

However as you say, maybe sqlite3 is a better option.


&gt;<i>An alternative I thought of some time ago, but never really got round to implementing beyond a demo program in the OSM plugin distribution, is a piece of &gt;software which will take an OSM file, or files, and render Mapnik tiles at various zoom levels from them. Rather like the <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-users">tiles at home</A> project, this would move the &gt;burden of data storage and rendering from server to client.
</I>
&gt;<i>This sounds interesting for sure, although honestly I'm not very familiar with <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-users">T at H</A>, so it would be great if you would describe this a bit more.
</I>
It's a distributed rendering project where people render OSM data using osmarender (XSLT to convert OSM-&gt;SVG) and inkscape (to convert SVG-&gt;PNG) on their home computers then upload to a server. When OSM users request a tile from the <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-users">tiles at home</A> server, the server instructs a client, or clients, to render the tile. Maybe something similar could be done with mapnik?


&gt;<i>It could also lower the barrier to creating your own Mapnik-based OSM site as you wouldn't have to install a PostGIS database, which IMX can be quite tricky to &gt;set up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Have you looked into SQLite3?
</I>
Will look at this.

Nick
