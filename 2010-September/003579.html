Hi,

I take my words back, partly ;) Benchmark was indeed a success and all
the end users will benefit from it because the next versions of all
servers which took part in the competition will have some improvements.
It is also possible to get some useful information from the results
<A HREF="http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/foss4g/benchmarking/scripts/results/benchmark">http://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/foss4g/benchmarking/scripts/results/benchmark</A>

However, it is important to read all the slides and not just look at the
graphs. In the slide #26 (three subsequent Geoserver runs) the slowest,
disk-bound run is actually the one that interests me most because that
is the situation we have in our production system. It would have been
nice to see disk-bound results from all the servers and compare the
speed we have now with those. It does not help us a lot to know that we
could be 20 times faster if we could keep our aerial photos in memory
because we would need not 8 gigabytes but 8 terabytes for that. For
comparing our speed with other about similar but most probably well
configured systems the 2009 results are still more usable for us

But as the Constellation team said, good testing is hard. Processors
seem to be at the moment so much faster than disk-I/O that a disk-bound
test would easily measure just how well different map servers can
utilise the disk system used in the test. It will be nice to see what
kind of tests we will see next year in Denver.
