<PRE>Hi.

I have been user of mapnik for almost two years and we started form earliest
versions.
Recently we decided to upgrade some of our old maps, so I do have a few
short questions about mapnik and stylesheet techniques.

1. Our current version is 0.6.0 on Debian.. We like to install new 0.7.0..
Should we remove old mapnik or use apt-get update? we don't want to lose our
old settings if any..how should we upgrade?

2- I do remember that Artem helped us about Arabic/Farsi scripts since from
0.6.0 unicode and Right to left languages were also supported. Still we have
a problem about parenthesis. If there is a parenthesis in the name, the
characters of Arabic/Farsi names become seperated. Like you want to put old
and new names of road like: Morgan Road (Blossom Road) .. In Farsi you write
&#1605;&#1585;&#1711;&#1575;&#1606; (&#1576;&#1604;&#1575;&#1587;&#1608;&#1605;)

the Right to Left feature has problem with parenthesis.

3- If we want to draw 100 roads and each road with different color, then we
don't know how to use stylesheets. Because mapnik just allows us to  use
name=&quot;field_name&quot; as the the only field we can read from database in
TextSymbolizer. but we have a field in our database called color which we
want to use it as well for Text color or Road color. How can we use that
field. FILTERS are good, but for each color we need a filter and then we
have 9 zoom levels, then it is a headache!! is there a facility in mapnik to
help us do it easier?

4- As I read in mapnik scale denominator page, it use 90.7 PPI as the base
for Scale calculations. But when we test our maps in openlayers, we see the
scale printed on lower corner is calculated based on 72 DPI...is it
something wrong with our settings in Openlayers or it is mapnik who
calculates in 72 PPI!!! which scale should we trust.


Many thanks
Alireza
