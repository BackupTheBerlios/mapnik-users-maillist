<PRE>Hi,

Great to hear from you. Thanks very much for your kind comments about 
mapnik. It can hopefully improve a lot as long as people post feature 
requests/ideas, like you have.
&gt;<i> First of all, mapnik is great and produces lovely stuff. I have some 
</I>&gt;<i> requests/questions about text rendering and filtering though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Labelling along line features, which is typically required for maps 
</I>&gt;<i> with roads on :)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, I really want this feature too:).  Vince Spader is working on this 
at the moment. I'll see if we can combine efforts to get this done 
quicker. 
&gt;<i> 3. Spacing of labelling, which was mentioned in a thread &quot;Textlabels&quot; by 
</I>&gt;<i> Jan Rademaker in May. It would be fantastic to be able to specify a 
</I>&gt;<i> minimum distance in pixels before we the same label is repeated.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>This is a good feature,too. From Jan's posting:
&quot; ...
What I would love to see is an option to specify the minimal distance
(in pixels, radius) between two labels. Probably more or less similar
to the collision detection but with a variable radius. That way, for
example, a river would always be identified by 4 labels on a 800x600px
map, regardless of the extent...&quot;

This sounds the way to start and it won't require many changes. 
&gt;<i> 3. Wrapping labels so they are contained within a polygon. Say you have 
</I>&gt;<i> a shopping center which is labelled &quot;very very long feature name&quot;. It 
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice to be able to wrap the label so it ended up centered in 
</I>&gt;<i> the polygon and looking something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> very very long
</I>&gt;<i> feature name
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I can see two approaches here:
1. Always wrap text if it is too long ( based on width/height ratio?).
2. For polygons, try to find a best fit (can be expensive).
Any more ideas?

&gt;<i> 4. Is there a way to filter based on the feature size? For example, only 
</I>&gt;<i> displaying rivers that are longer than 1km at certain zoom levels. Is 
</I>&gt;<i> this something worthwhile to add?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I had plans to add support for 'functions' in filter expressions. AREA 
and LENGTH are good candidates. Having said that, pre-calculated values 
stored in the attribute would be more efficient.     
&gt;<i> If I get motivated enough I might start working on some of these myself, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I'd like to get some feedback and ideas first.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Absolutely. Does the above spark any more thoughts for you? Let's keep 
talking, since I'm really keen for more people to join us.

Cheers,
Artem
