</I>Yes! Sooner the better!
&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Spacing of labelling, which was mentioned in a thread &quot;Textlabels&quot; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by Jan Rademaker in May. It would be fantastic to be able to specify 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a minimum distance in pixels before we the same label is repeated.   
</I>&gt;<i> This is a good feature,too. From Jan's posting:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot; ...
</I>&gt;<i> What I would love to see is an option to specify the minimal distance
</I>&gt;<i> (in pixels, radius) between two labels. Probably more or less similar
</I>&gt;<i> to the collision detection but with a variable radius. That way, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, a river would always be identified by 4 labels on a 800x600px
</I>&gt;<i> map, regardless of the extent...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds the way to start and it won't require many changes.
</I>I guess there are two things. One, repeating of labels for the same 
feature. Second is repeating of identical labels for different features. 
I know one can probably work around this using nasty DB hacks but my 
data models (esp for road networks) come split into small segments :)
&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Wrapping labels so they are contained within a polygon. Say you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a shopping center which is labelled &quot;very very long feature 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name&quot;. It would be nice to be able to wrap the label so it ended up 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> centered in the polygon and looking something like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very very long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feature name  
</I>&gt;<i> I can see two approaches here:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Always wrap text if it is too long ( based on width/height ratio?).
</I>&gt;<i> 2. For polygons, try to find a best fit (can be expensive).
</I>&gt;<i> Any more ideas?
</I>I think #1 is a good start, then wait and see if anyone requires a lot 
more cleverness than that (Pareto's Principle).
&gt;<i> 4. Is there a way to filter based on the feature size? For example, 
</I>&gt;<i> only displaying rivers that are longer than 1km at certain zoom 
</I>&gt;<i> levels. Is this something worthwhile to add?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had plans to add support for 'functions' in filter expressions. AREA 
</I>&gt;<i> and LENGTH are good candidates. Having said that, pre-calculated 
</I>&gt;<i> values stored in the attribute would be more efficient.   
</I>That's true. :)
&gt;&gt;<i> If I get motivated enough I might start working on some of these 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> myself, but I'd like to get some feedback and ideas first.  
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely. Does the above spark any more thoughts for you? Let's keep 
</I>&gt;<i> talking, since I'm really keen for more people to join us.
</I>Well, one of our guys is adapting our map-style GUI to generate mapnik 
python code, so you might have a cross-platform UI soon :)

Cheers,

Rob :)
