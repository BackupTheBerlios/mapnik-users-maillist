<PRE>Hello,

I've been working on a major update to Cascadenik, on a branch:
	<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mapnik-utils/source/browse/branches/cascadenik-xmlbad">http://code.google.com/p/mapnik-utils/source/browse/branches/cascadenik-xmlbad</A>

There shouldn't be any external changes in behavior, but I've been  
slowly modifying the library from one that transforms one kind of XML  
into another kind of XML, to a library that operates directly on a  
mapnik.Map object via the Python bindings. In particular, I was happy  
to find out that it's possible to serialize a mapnik.Map object to XML  
directly using save_map(), so that's how the cascadenik-compile.py  
script now works. All of my tests are being performed against a two- 
month-old trunk build, which I *think* means they should be compatible  
with 0.5 installations out in the wild.

Most of the actual edits were in compile.py, but the most relevant  
code is here:
	<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mapnik-utils/source/browse/branches/cascadenik-xmlbad/cascadenik/output.py">http://code.google.com/p/mapnik-utils/source/browse/branches/cascadenik-xmlbad/cascadenik/output.py</A>

See especially the to_mapnik() methods - they take a cascadenik- 
specific brew of Layer, Style, Rule and Symbolizer classes and use  
them to drive mapnik's own bindings. Having had a chance to work with  
the bindings a bunch, I have some ideas on how they could be improved.  
The contents of that output.py file are where I think mapnik's  
bindings should be. A few thoughts:

1. Less C++, more native python. Currently the bindings seems to  
mostly be direct interfaces to the compiled library, which makes it  
more difficult to look inside and see what's going on, and enforces a  
shortlist of accepted method signatures. It would be good for many of  
the classes here to be pure python:
	<A HREF="http://svn.mapnik.org/tags/release-0.6.0/docs/api_docs/python/mapnik._mapnik-module.html">http://svn.mapnik.org/tags/release-0.6.0/docs/api_docs/python/mapnik._mapnik-module.html</A>

2. Heavier use of keyword args in constructors. I've put all possible  
symbolizer parameters for the few that I've made into the  
constructors, which removes the situation in the wiki GettingStarted  
page where it's necessary to instantiate an object and then perform  
further changes to it to get it all working. In particular, it should  
be possible to populate a mapnik.Map object with style and layer  
information in an entirely declarative fashion, as shown in this test  
from cascadenik:
	<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/mapnik-utils/source/browse/branches/cascadenik-xmlbad/test.py#1519">http://code.google.com/p/mapnik-utils/source/browse/branches/cascadenik-xmlbad/test.py#1519</A>

3. Real lists. The python bindings make heavy use of append() methods  
that give the impression of regular python list objects under the  
hood. Generally, appending a layer or style to a mapnik.Map actually  
makes a deeper change, and subsequent attempts to reorder the list or  
remove items fail. I think it would be interesting for mapnik.Map to  
be a fully-editable and introspectable python object, with plain old  
lists and dictionaries where possible, instead of a mystery Boost  
thing. The to_mapnik methods I wrote above are a fairly clumsy  
implementation of late compilation

4. Explicit defaults in serialized XML. I was confused when outputting  
XML, when LineSymbolizer CssParameters for black colors or one pixel  
widths were not being output. I understand that this is because black  
+ one pixel is the assumed default in mapnik, but I can imagine a  
situation where that might change, and it'd be useful for output XML  
that might span multiple mapnik releases to include these things.

Anyway, that's all. The branch is about 90% done, I still need to deal  
with datasources and all the symbolizers that use images.

-mike.
