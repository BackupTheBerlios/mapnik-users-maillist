<PRE>Hello everyone! I have followed Carlos' example and created a blog with my
proposal, please feel free to comment in it.

<A HREF="http://easyprintablemaps.blogspot.com/">http://easyprintablemaps.blogspot.com/</A>

Thanks!

&gt;<i> Hi Carlos,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great to see your proposal coming together!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are my comments (I've also pasted them as a comment in the blog) at:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://betterprintsupport.blogspot.com/2010/04/draft-proposal.html">http://betterprintsupport.blogspot.com/2010/04/draft-proposal.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * First Paragraph: the problem is not just when printing maps to PDF.
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly many people target PDF output when going to print but all formats
</I>&gt;<i> require advances to support high resolution output/scaling. But, I
</I>&gt;<i> understand why you stated it this way, because the example of townguide
</I>&gt;<i> pushing PNG output into a PDF certainly highlights easy problems that needs
</I>&gt;<i> fixing. The more advanced way to provide PDF output is to render all map
</I>&gt;<i> features as vectors into the PDF (or SVG). Even thought the PDF format can
</I>&gt;<i> support embedded rasters, usually when high resolution output is desired the
</I>&gt;<i> PDF will look better and be of smaller size when all vectors are used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I like the way you've divided up the application into &quot;control over
</I>&gt;<i> scaling&quot; and &quot;post-processing&quot;! Very nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * &quot;Better post-processable output&quot; section says: &quot;photo editing
</I>&gt;<i> applications&quot;. Really people are using vector editing or vector drawing
</I>&gt;<i> applications like inkscape and illustrator, not photo applications (which
</I>&gt;<i> work on rasters). I'm sure you understand this, its likely just a typo...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * You say &quot;so the challenge is to investigate, design and implement an
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm for scaling raster&quot;. Actually I think it is easy to scale rasters,
</I>&gt;<i> and in fact the algorithms to do so (always uses to scale down) are already
</I>&gt;<i> available inside mapnik (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://svn.mapnik.org/trunk/include/mapnik/graphics.hpp_">http://svn.mapnik.org/trunk/include/mapnik/graphics.hpp_</A>). The trick is
</I>&gt;<i> that certain objects need to be scaled BEFORE being painted onto raster
</I>&gt;<i> surfaces. In some cases this is easy, e.g. if higher resolution output is
</I>&gt;<i> requested (to be rendered by AGG) then larger fonts and line widths can be
</I>&gt;<i> fetched before rendering, etc... I've not given it much thought, but
</I>&gt;<i> potentially the &quot;scaling&quot; factor will need to be different depending on
</I>&gt;<i> whether the output is raster (via AGG) or vector (via Cairo). Not something
</I>&gt;<i> that needs to be solved now of course, but a fun challenge to test this
</I>&gt;<i> summer :) Symbols are different of course, because currently mapnik only
</I>&gt;<i> supports raster symbols which, if scaled up, look bad. But you cover this
</I>&gt;<i> later on, so let's not worry about this to much now...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The next several paragraphs in that sections are great!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Re: &quot;Implementation of an algorithm for scaling raster symbols if needed
</I>&gt;<i> (this point needs to be investigated further to determine its applicability
</I>&gt;<i> in the project&quot; - this is good enough for the application. We can talk more
</I>&gt;<i> about this. In particular Tom Carden has some ideas that might help that he
</I>&gt;<i> is researching. And Artem has recommended using AGG SVG parser to read
</I>&gt;<i> symbols in a format that can then be easily scaled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * in relation to writing a new svg_renderer: I talked with Artem more about
</I>&gt;<i> this today and I want to confirm that I think this is a very good idea that
</I>&gt;<i> it should be feasible to have a part of the project, with Artem's guidance,
</I>&gt;<i> so he will be the primary contact in advising this. However, you say &quot;cairo_renderer
</I>&gt;<i> already produces SVG output, but does so in a rather slow way [7]. &quot; I think
</I>&gt;<i> a native svg authoring renderer certainly could be written to be faster than
</I>&gt;<i> cairo, but the main idea is that we need something more flexible that Cairo
</I>&gt;<i> can provide, to be able to customize our output for more of the varied
</I>&gt;<i>  usecases of SVG/Post-processing. We can talk more about these later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I really admire and support your ideas about how your skills can
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to Mapnik and GIS software as a whole. Bringing Math and Graphics
</I>&gt;<i> skills to GIS problems is exactly the basic of this project, so great stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I also think the collaboration with Waldemar is fantastic - thanks for
</I>&gt;<i> making this possible.
