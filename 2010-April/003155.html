&gt;<i> Good afternoon,

</I>&gt;<i> I have been working on my proposal, but some doubts arose:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. As I understand, Ben Moores' pdf renderer implements all the  
</I>&gt;<i> functions for processing each kind of symbolizer, following the  
</I>&gt;<i> model of agg_renderer and cairo_renderer.
</I>
Oh, interesting, I was not aware of this, so thanks for reporting how  
it works...

This then sounds like it is a parallel type of implementation, a  
`pdf_renderer` that in addition contains the logic for adornments,  
since wxpdfdoc supports drawing extra things (like Cairo API) plus  
maintaining logical layering in PDF (which we presume Cairo does not  
expose).

&gt;<i> agg_renderer and cairo_renderer are currently designed to produce  
</I>&gt;<i> output as raster images for displaying in the screen.
</I>
Well, not exactly. They each render to their respective surfaces, agg  
being a raster_ptr (artem will know more about this), and cairo being  
a generic context/surface that is specifically intended to then  
support being pushed into either PNG (raster), or vector formats  
(pdf,svg,postscript, and others potentially if compiled in). So while  
AGG usage and library is limited to raster images Cairo is designed  
around more abstract interface to have different output. Hence this is  
why in these discussions sometimes we tend to lean toward  
cairo_renderer (or lean away due to limitations).

&gt;<i> The difference between these and pdf_renderer is the target output.
</I>
certainly a difference, yes. I know see Ben Moore's branch as most  
similar to artem's idea of a very tailored new svg_renderer, just  
different format and goals based on strengths of the format.

&gt;<i> So this makes me think that all the adornment elements, such as the  
</I>&gt;<i> grids and the scales, might be part of a last processing before  
</I>&gt;<i> rendering (as they might me placed in the upper layers).
</I>
Yes, certainly. But I can see value to at least two different ways to  
allowing easy addition of adornments:

1) drawn on a &quot;map canvas&quot; that goes on top of rendered map (from any  
backend)
  *** to support single image, easily printable Map***

and

2) ability to fetch an adornment as a separate object from the mapnik  
api (python or C++) to be displayed in an application, say a web site  
of in Mapnik Viewer.
*** to support programmatic addition of adornments ***

The latter is a bit off-topic i realize but ideally the design could  
accommodate both.


&gt;<i> However, I know that these elements must be implemented in each  
</I>&gt;<i> renderer, since a different API is used. So if I understand  
</I>&gt;<i> correctly, the adornments are not elements that are only needed in  
</I>&gt;<i> printed maps, but also in the maps displayed on the screen. Am I  
</I>&gt;<i> correct so far?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well put, and addresses my idea as per above.

&gt;<i> 2. Robert Coup mentions that the idea is to add these elements to  
</I>&gt;<i> the cairo_renderer. So both the adornments and the variable- 
</I>&gt;<i> resolution/units ideas are for improving the cairo_renderer. Is this  
</I>&gt;<i> correct?
</I>
Yes, both these things should be generic to all renderers. It's just  
that because target was PDF, and Cairo can produce PDF that cairo- 
renderer was discussed first.

&gt;<i> I think I should find a way to define these ideas more abstractly in  
</I>&gt;<i> the code, so the cairo, agg and svg renderers benefit from this  
</I>&gt;<i> addition, not only the cairo-based one.
</I>
Exactly.

&gt;<i> Maybe define a set of classes that could be shared between  
</I>&gt;<i> renderers, leaving the specifics of how to display them to the  
</I>&gt;<i> renderers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
!!!!!

&gt;<i> 3. I still think that the svg_renderer would be worth implementing  
</I>&gt;<i> this summer, though I would like to know your opinion on which ideas  
</I>&gt;<i> have a higher priority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I will defer to artem on this. I think it is a great idea, but a bit  
beyond my skill level and familiarity with svg. Either way it seems  
like a phase II thing after variable-resolution/units/pixels issues  
are solved.



&gt;<i> Thank you, I hope I can send a draft of my proposal tonight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Wonderful!

</I>&gt;<i> I encourage everyone following this thread to respond to carlos's  
</I>&gt;<i> summary ideas. The applications are due soon and the more feedback  
</I>&gt;<i> he has the more likely the project with be accepted and in a form  
</I>&gt;<i> that is both exciting and feasible for the summer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On Saturday is whercamp and I hope to have a session with Mike  
</I>&gt;<i> Migurski and Tom Carden to discuss mentorship and progress so far.  
</I>&gt;<i> At this point I feel very impressed with carlos's awesome research

</I>&gt;<i> Good afternoon, how are you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was talking yesterday with Mr. Springmeyer about the scope of this  
</I>&gt;<i> project to determine the main goals and tasks. From the ideas  
</I>&gt;<i> discussed in this thread, I identify three major groups:  
</I>&gt;<i> Improvements in resolution, the implementation of a renderer based  
</I>&gt;<i> on SVG, and the addition of 'adornments' or informative elements  
</I>&gt;<i> (grids, scale bars, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each group has its own level of difficulty. However, I see more  
</I>&gt;<i> complexity in the implementation of the SVG renderer. I think it  
</I>&gt;<i> represents a major design task that deserves attention from a more  
</I>&gt;<i> experienced developer. As I'm new to the project, I think I would do  
</I>&gt;<i> better if I worked in the other two groups of ideas, which seem to  
</I>&gt;<i> have very clear and defined boundaries. This would help me become  
</I>&gt;<i> more familiar with the design and structure of Mapnik and would  
</I>&gt;<i> allow me to contribute in a better way in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think you'll have a better perspective of the problem, so  
</I>&gt;<i> I'd love to hear your opinions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
