<PRE>Good afternoon,

I have been working on my proposal, but some doubts arose:

1. As I understand, Ben Moores' pdf renderer implements all the functions
for processing each kind of symbolizer, following the model of agg_renderer
and cairo_renderer. agg_renderer and cairo_renderer are currently designed
to produce output as raster images for displaying in the screen. The
difference between these and pdf_renderer is the target output. So this
makes me think that all the adornment elements, such as the grids and the
scales, might be part of a last processing before rendering (as they might
me placed in the upper layers). However, I know that these elements must be
implemented in each renderer, since a different API is used. So if I
understand correctly, the adornments are not elements that are only needed
in printed maps, but also in the maps displayed on the screen. Am I correct
so far?

2. Robert Coup mentions that the idea is to add these elements to the
cairo_renderer. So both the adornments and the variable-resolution/units
ideas are for improving the cairo_renderer. Is this correct? I think I
should find a way to define these ideas more abstractly in the code, so the
cairo, agg and svg renderers benefit from this addition, not only the
cairo-based one. Maybe define a set of classes that could be shared between
renderers, leaving the specifics of how to display them to the renderers.

3. I still think that the svg_renderer would be worth implementing this
summer, though I would like to know your opinion on which ideas have a
higher priority.

Thank you, I hope I can send a draft of my proposal tonight.

&gt;<i> I encourage everyone following this thread to respond to carlos's summary
</I>&gt;<i> ideas. The applications are due soon and the more feedback he has the more
</I>&gt;<i> likely the project with be accepted and in a form that is both exciting and
</I>&gt;<i> feasible for the summer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On Saturday is whercamp and I hope to have a session with Mike Migurski and
</I>&gt;<i> Tom Carden to discuss mentorship and progress so far. At this point I feel
</I>&gt;<i> very impressed with carlos's awesome research and the fantastic community
</I>&gt;<i> brainstorming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good afternoon, how are you?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was talking yesterday with Mr. Springmeyer about the scope of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project to determine the main goals and tasks. From the ideas discussed in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this thread, I identify three major groups: Improvements in resolution, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation of a renderer based on SVG, and the addition of 'adornments'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or informative elements (grids, scale bars, etc.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each group has its own level of difficulty. However, I see more complexity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the implementation of the SVG renderer. I think it represents a major
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design task that deserves attention from a more experienced developer. As
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm new to the project, I think I would do better if I worked in the other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two groups of ideas, which seem to have very clear and defined boundaries.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would help me become more familiar with the design and structure of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mapnik and would allow me to contribute in a better way in the future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I think you'll have a better perspective of the problem, so I'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> love to hear your opinions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks
