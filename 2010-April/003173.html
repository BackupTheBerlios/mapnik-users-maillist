<PRE>Hi Carlos,

Great to see your proposal coming together!

Here are my comments (I've also pasted them as a comment in the blog)  
at:

<A HREF="http://betterprintsupport.blogspot.com/2010/04/draft-proposal.html">http://betterprintsupport.blogspot.com/2010/04/draft-proposal.html</A>

* First Paragraph: the problem is not just when printing maps to PDF.  
Certainly many people target PDF output when going to print but all  
formats require advances to support high resolution output/scaling.  
But, I understand why you stated it this way, because the example of  
townguide pushing PNG output into a PDF certainly highlights easy  
problems that needs fixing. The more advanced way to provide PDF  
output is to render all map features as vectors into the PDF (or SVG).  
Even thought the PDF format can support embedded rasters, usually when  
high resolution output is desired the PDF will look better and be of  
smaller size when all vectors are used.

* I like the way you've divided up the application into &quot;control over  
scaling&quot; and &quot;post-processing&quot;! Very nice.

* &quot;Better post-processable output&quot; section says: &quot;photo editing  
applications&quot;. Really people are using vector editing or vector  
drawing applications like inkscape and illustrator, not photo  
applications (which work on rasters). I'm sure you understand this,  
its likely just a typo...

* You say &quot;so the challenge is to investigate, design and implement an  
algorithm for scaling raster&quot;. Actually I think it is easy to scale  
rasters, and in fact the algorithms to do so (always uses to scale  
down) are already available inside mapnik (<A HREF="http://svn.mapnik.org/trunk/include/mapnik/graphics.hpp">http://svn.mapnik.org/trunk/include/mapnik/graphics.hpp</A>_ 
). The trick is that certain objects need to be scaled BEFORE being  
painted onto raster surfaces. In some cases this is easy, e.g. if  
higher resolution output is requested (to be rendered by AGG) then  
larger fonts and line widths can be fetched before rendering, etc...  
I've not given it much thought, but potentially the &quot;scaling&quot; factor  
will need to be different depending on whether the output is raster  
(via AGG) or vector (via Cairo). Not something that needs to be solved  
now of course, but a fun challenge to test this summer :) Symbols are  
different of course, because currently mapnik only supports raster  
symbols which, if scaled up, look bad. But you cover this later on, so  
let's not worry about this to much now...

* The next several paragraphs in that sections are great!

* Re: &quot;Implementation of an algorithm for scaling raster symbols if  
needed (this point needs to be investigated further to determine its  
applicability in the project&quot; - this is good enough for the  
application. We can talk more about this. In particular Tom Carden has  
some ideas that might help that he is researching. And Artem has  
recommended using AGG SVG parser to read symbols in a format that can  
then be easily scaled.

* in relation to writing a new svg_renderer: I talked with Artem more  
about this today and I want to confirm that I think this is a very  
good idea that it should be feasible to have a part of the project,  
with Artem's guidance, so he will be the primary contact in advising  
this. However, you say &quot;cairo_renderer already produces SVG output,  
but does so in a rather slow way [7]. &quot; I think a native svg authoring  
renderer certainly could be written to be faster than cairo, but the  
main idea is that we need something more flexible that Cairo can  
provide, to be able to customize our output for more of the varied   
usecases of SVG/Post-processing. We can talk more about these later.

* I really admire and support your ideas about how your skills can  
contribute to Mapnik and GIS software as a whole. Bringing Math and  
Graphics skills to GIS problems is exactly the basic of this project,  
so great stuff.

* I also think the collaboration with Waldemar is fantastic - thanks  
for making this possible.
