<PRE>I realize that the WMS OGCServer that sits on top of Mapnik is only a
single threaded application but if I did the following to simulate a
multi-threaded application would this be feasible?

Have 10 command windows running a different wms_WSGI_4326.py script
(1-10) as a WSGI standalone server with the only difference being that
each script refers to a different port number (8001-8008).  On top of
all these servers is geowebcache which processes the WMS requests to
it from the client back to each of these WSGI standalone servers in
round robin format.

Does this make sense?

Thanks,

John
