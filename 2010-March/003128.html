Great, thanks!

</I>&gt;<i> questions make sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You bet, nice thought!

&gt;<i> Talking to Waldemar and reading some resources in the OpenStreetMap  
</I>&gt;<i> wiki, I found out that a major need this project has is the  
</I>&gt;<i> capability to customize the way a map is printed in digital file  
</I>&gt;<i> formats, such as PDF, Illustrator's and Inkcape's, so it can later  
</I>&gt;<i> be printed to paper of various sizes.
</I>
Exactly.

&gt;<i> People find it hard to print a map correctly because difficult extra  
</I>&gt;<i> steps are necessary,
</I>
Yes and no regarding extra steps.

Some users main goal is to enhance/customize Mapnik maps with the  
target of post-processing the output. Other users may not be concerned  
about any postprocessing, and rather just need customized maps at  
higher resolution, or rotated, or with auto-generated scalebars.

&gt;<i> which require the knowledge of other tools, and the results are  
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes inaccurate.
</I>
Perhaps inaccurate, but more likely not aesthetically perfect or  
otherwise hard to get the GIS data into a design application to be  
edited further.

&gt;<i> To mention examples of the former issue, Nicolas Marichal says that  
</I>&gt;<i> lacking the capability of turning on/off specific layers the  
</I>&gt;<i> resulting map files tend to be too large to be handled properly  
</I>&gt;<i> (Waldemar showed me a PDF file generated with MapOSMatic that was  
</I>&gt;<i> really large and that caused his PDF viewer to crash (I hope this is  
</I>&gt;<i> what Nicolas Marichal was talking about)),
</I>
Interesting. I've not noticed this problem before of the PDF output  
being too big. It would be good to know more about which PDF viewer  
Waldermar was using to try to investigate more why it crashed.

That does bring up another interesting idea - that perhaps we should  
add the ability to smooth/simplify the vector output generated by the  
cairo_renderer to allow for smaller file sizes. However, usually when  
users want to print out maps they intend to print to large paper, and  
so a bigger PDF is better. But certainly in some cases smaller output  
could be desirable. I'm not sure that is within the realm of &quot;better  
print support&quot; but it is an interesting idea nonetheless.

I think Nicolas was referring to a different problem for his use case.  
I think he has primarily used the 'Export' function to generate a PDF  
from this page:

<A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org/export/">http://www.openstreetmap.org/export/</A>

In this case the PDF is generated from the default 'osm.xml' located at:

<A HREF="http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/rendering/mapnik/">http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/rendering/mapnik/</A>

I think there are two key problems here for users that want PDF output  
to post-process, both of which could be solved nicely through a web  
interface + some custom stylesheets.

1) That 'Export' interface on the openstreetmap/export page does not  
have a web based mechanism to allow for turning on or off layers  
(essentially setting the &lt;Layer status=&quot;off&quot;&gt;), which Mapnik supports.  
So this could be supported by writing a web application to expose  
options to the user to control which layers Mapnik renders.

2) The default 'osm.xml' style has some very sophisticated and complex  
logic to display various OpenStreetMap features that targets nice  
looking PNG output, not vector (PDF/SVG) output.

For example, because the &quot;Painters Algorithm&quot; is used in Mapnik  
problems like nice looking &quot;Road Casings&quot; are solved by drawing  
repeated features several times with different symbolizers. While this  
looks good in PNG output (and likely just as nice to the eye in PDF/ 
SVG output), if the goal is post processing (vector output) this  
approach leads to many overlapping lines that are very difficult to  
later edit/select/change. Potentially in Inkscape or Illustrator a  
user would be wanting just the raw road line or a few types of roads,  
as single lines part of one layer, because the look of nice road  
casings could be achieved through different methods in the design  
application.

So, a large part of this problem could again be solved by a web-based  
interface that allowed the user to choose between a few different  
Mapnik XML styles that could be written (I could help with this as I'm  
sure many other Mapnik users!) to produce more simple layers and  
styling. Basically, new XML styles and layers could be created that  
better match the exact types of OSM features the user might want to  
post-process, and the web interface could allow some level of  
customization that exposed the ability to combine or separate features  
into different layers.

I must note that my ideas here will not solve all of the issues  
Nicholas raises, but I think they would help a lot and are the easier  
and more rewarding first steps. To solve all of the issues at once  
that Nicholas raises one might be better off with a very different  
approach, which is to use/extent the osm2ai script that is specially  
designed around turning osm data into basic vectors for adobe  
illustrator. A web interface built for this project could potentially  
add that as an option too, but overall I see great value to furthering  
Mapnik's support for better post-processable output because Mapnik  
works with more than just OSM data and most of these ideas,  
particularly those that could be solved through a web interface to  
customize output, would also benefit users that seek PNG output too.

&gt;<i> containing unnecessary elements the user may not want to see in her  
</I>&gt;<i> map. About the latter issue, he mentions that some elements are  
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes displayed in wrong positions (&quot;water areas sometimes  
</I>&gt;<i> appear wrong, as if the city is flooded&quot;); I guess this is the  
</I>&gt;<i> result of resizing or scaling the map.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Regarding wrong display, the &quot;flooding&quot; issue may be easily solved in  
his case by updated osm coastline data, but perhaps it also has  
resulted from bad conversion of polygons to svg/pdf vectors. This is  
something that could use more investigation and would be a good ticket  
at mapnik trac.

&gt;<i> To overcome these problems, you suggest that OSM's &quot;Easy Printable  
</I>&gt;<i> Maps&quot; project should be based upon the work done in the &quot;Better  
</I>&gt;<i> Print Support&quot; project, which will address some of the issues  
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned above.
</I>
Yes, as above. But certainly a web interface to make printing maps  
easier (and better looking, or better for post-processing) could also  
integrate a few other tools than Mapnik is beneficial.

&gt;<i> The existence of tickets #343, #320, #389 and #358 is a sign that  
</I>&gt;<i> the intention of improving Mapnik in these areas has existed for  
</I>&gt;<i> quite a long time now.
</I>
Yes, exactly, although they are actually not that old. I think they  
are just now really gaining attention and need and thats when things  
really start getting done :)

&gt;<i> Reading the description of these tickets, I realize that they are  
</I>&gt;<i> indeed related to what Graham Jones identifies as the main concerns  
</I>&gt;<i> of these two projects, namely 'resolution', 'rendering options' and  
</I>&gt;<i> 'scale'. I'll comment on these tickets next (please, tell me if any  
</I>&gt;<i> of the ideas I've mentioned so far are wrong):
</I>
Yes!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ticket #343 (Add a resolution parameter to Map object): The goal  
</I>&gt;<i> here would be to be possible for the user to specify the resolution  
</I>&gt;<i> at which the map should be printed in the digital file (pdf, ai,  
</I>&gt;<i> inkscape, etc.), expressed as a scaling factor that would manipulate  
</I>&gt;<i> the size of symbols, fonts, lines, etc. The scaling should be done  
</I>&gt;<i> in such a way that the spatial relationships between elements is  
</I>&gt;<i> preserved (to prevent lakes from moving, for example). My question  
</I>&gt;<i> here would be if the capability of specifying a custom resolution  
</I>&gt;<i> parameter is what you refer to as 'multi-resolution'.
</I>
Yes. I think my term &quot;multi-resolution&quot; is a bit confusing. Maybe  
variable-resolution is more appropriate, but either way you are  
certainly understanding.

I created #343 and wrote the initial patch very quickly and I need to  
look back to fix up and improve. I will do this this week. My thinking  
now is that even if we do not have the proper ability to scale symbols  
yet (#320), adding this functionality would still help immensely. The  
main task here will be testing and fine-tuning to make sure that the  
scaling is appropriate and flexible enough (I will comment more on the  
ticket).

Also, for a concise discussion of this idea (in a different software  
project), see also:

<A HREF="http://igorbrejc.net/openstreetmap/maperitive-bitmap-scaling">http://igorbrejc.net/openstreetmap/maperitive-bitmap-scaling</A>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ticket #389 (Add optional but explicit units everywhere): As I  
</I>&gt;<i> understand, Mapnik currently uses PPIs as the unit for specifying  
</I>&gt;<i> the resolution of the map, but it is desirable that other  
</I>&gt;<i> measurement units, like mm, cm and microns, be used as well (I'm not  
</I>&gt;<i> completely sure about this, though).
</I>
We should take more with Mike Migurski about this. I think that my  
comment on that ticket may be off topic.

&gt;<i> As the title of this ticket states, it should be possible to specify  
</I>&gt;<i> everything that's measurable inside the map using various units  
</I>&gt;<i> (Robert Coup mentions in his reply to my latest message in the  
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list that longitude and latitude lines should also be  
</I>&gt;<i> displayed using units other than degrees, like meters). Finally, the  
</I>&gt;<i> default unit should be pixels.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, great description. Basically I think Mapnik should be able to  
convert various units so that users that think better in units other  
than pixels could more easily author stylesheets - this is  
particularly relevant to Cascadenik. But the idea may go beyond this,  
so we should check with Mike.

&gt;<i> Ticket #320 (SVG-Based Symbolizers): I don't have enough information  
</I>&gt;<i> to comment here, but Mr. Pavlenko said he is interested in an SVG  
</I>&gt;<i> renderer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, this one is hard and my feeling is that it is not within the  
scope of GSOC, but I'd be happy to be wrong. The main functionality  
here is already implemented, but the Mapnik developers need to discuss  
further about the approach. I think that Artem is interested in using  
the more basic support inside AGG for reading/rendering SVG instead/in  
addition to RSVG, but we should hear more from him.

Also, I think his idea for an SVG renderer is different. #320 is about  
being able to read/render SVG symbols and I think what an  
'svg_renderer.cpp' would be about is writing a new output renderer  
that would be very good at authoring SVG (better than Cairo). This  
could be very very useful for Nicholas and others than desire optimal  
SVG output for post-processing. I think Nicholas used the PDF output  
in the past over SVG because Cairo's PDF output is slightly better  
supported than SVG, though SVG may be more desirable/flexibly for post- 
processing in general.

&gt;<i> Ticket #358 (Implementation of map borders and coordinate grids  
</I>&gt;<i> similar to those provided by GMT): The features discussed in this  
</I>&gt;<i> ticket are those that Robert Coup suggested (in his reply to my  
</I>&gt;<i> message in the mailing list) and that are already implemented in the  
</I>&gt;<i> experimental-pdf branch, but using WXPDFDOC. The idea here is to  
</I>&gt;<i> provide these features with a Cairo-based renderer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> My questions for Mr. Migurski and Mr. Carden would be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #1 I don't fully understand what they mean with &quot;use the same  
</I>&gt;<i> renderer for web cartography as multi-resolution cartography&quot;. I  
</I>&gt;<i> interpret the sentence as providing support for producing maps with  
</I>&gt;<i> different resolutions within the same renderer (Cairo-based  
</I>&gt;<i> preferably).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, you are understanding right. I actually added that line - sorry  
it is not very clear! :) Mostly what I am getting at is that Mapnik  
Core should be extended (as discusssed above) so that variable  
resolution output is better supported both in the cairo_renderer  
output (PDF/SVG) and in the agg_renderer (PNG).

&gt;<i> #2 Does my vision of the project agree with theirs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, but we should hear from them as well soon.

&gt;<i> I'll post the contents of this email in the mailing list too. Maybe  
</I>&gt;<i> other members might want to add their comments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, please. I hope that others add comments as I am just thinking  
through my experience of hearing from users and thinking about how to  
better solve problems in Mapnik. Other users will have more clear  
ideas on many subjects.

&gt;<i> Thanks in advance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Carlos Enrique L&#243;pez Garc&#233;s

Thank you Carlos - amazing research, discussion, and ideas. Great stuff.
