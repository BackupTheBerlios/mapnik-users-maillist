<PRE>Hi Carlos,

2010/3/29 Dane Springmeyer &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-users">blake at hailmail.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> First of all - really great approach. Summarizing your understanding as a
</I>&gt;<i> way to frame further questions is really helpful, so thanks for this effort.
</I>
+1 , great to see :)

&gt;<i> - Adding a border to the map to show coordinates: I interpret this as
</I>&gt;<i> displaying a frame around the map that shows the longitude and latitude
</I>&gt;<i> coordinates. The more the map is zoomed in, the more exact the coordinates
</I>&gt;<i> will be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
may include non-geographic projections (ie. coordinates other than
latitude &amp; longitude). eg. New Zealand Transverse Mercator
(<A HREF="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/2193/">http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/2193/</A>)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Grids: I interpret this as displaying the longitude and latitude lines
</I>&gt;<i> over the map.
</I>
likewise, the units may be in meters rather than degrees.

&gt;<i> - Overlay images, including other PDFs: Does the 'overlay' concept have the
</I>&gt;<i> same meaning as in Google Maps? According to Google Maps' documentation, an
</I>&gt;<i> overlay is an object attached to a coordinate, like the markers used to
</I>&gt;<i> point to places
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapplets/overlays.html#Markers">http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapplets/overlays.html#Markers</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> If this is true, then this feature is about displaying these overlay images
</I>&gt;<i> on the exact points indicated by the associated coordinates (considering
</I>&gt;<i> that the units used for displaying on the screen and printing on a document
</I>&gt;<i> are different, am I right?). I'm not sure if I understand the part
</I>&gt;<i> 'including other PDFs', though.
</I>
I was thinking adding other stuff to a &quot;document&quot;. So maybe a
watermark, legend, logo, version/id/user/date information, or having
some way of fitting a map into a report. Isn't really a major, I think
you can do that stuff with PDF tools (better to do it outside mapnik
if its possible).

&gt;<i> - Paper sizes/scale calculations: I read that images are displayed on paper
</I>&gt;<i> based on DPI units, so some calculations are needed to scale the maps to fit
</I>&gt;<i> different paper sizes. Tom Hughes mentions in the same thread that there are
</I>&gt;<i> some issues that need to be considered when tranlating the units used by
</I>&gt;<i> Mapnik and those of Cairo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, these are core issues that should be worked out, tested, investigated
</I>&gt;<i> pretty early. I see you are playing around
</I>&gt;<i> with&#160;<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/343,">http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/343,</A> which is great.
</I>
Also things like making sure the scale is a &quot;round&quot; number (eg.
1:1000, not 1:992.68), or specifying a fixed scale.

One use case is being able to fit an extent inside an A3 sheet at
either 1:1000, 1:5000, or 1:10000 scale, whichever is smallest.

Mapnik doesn't need to do all that, just expose a way for the user to
calculate things.

&gt;<i> - Map layers as PDF layers: According to what I read, the objects displayed
</I>&gt;<i> on a PDF page can be organized in layers, which can be hidden. As a map is
</I>&gt;<i> rendered in layers, whose order is defined by a Mapnik configuration file
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/XMLConfigReference">http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/XMLConfigReference</A>), a PDF layer may be mapped
</I>&gt;<i> to a map layer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, mostly. Basically most recent PDF viewers support the idea of layers,
</I>&gt;<i> such that users can turn various layers on and off, adding interactivity and
</I>&gt;<i> usefulness of the document, particularly when map data is included. Being
</I>&gt;<i> able to maintain the exact &quot;&lt;Layer&gt;&quot; elements created by a user authoring a
</I>&gt;<i> Mapnik XML file as &quot;layers&quot; in the resulting PDF file would be an excellent
</I>&gt;<i> thing, but potentially users would also want combinations of Mapnik
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;Layer&gt;'s to be exposed as PDF &quot;layers&quot;.
</I>
Ben's original work mapped Mapnik Layers to PDF Layers. Basically
Adobe Acrobat reader has a layers panel when you open such a PDF, and
you can show/hide layers. It was only for layers that were actually
rendered by mapnik, so as Dane said, status=off layers wouldn't be in
the PDF at all.

Rob :)
