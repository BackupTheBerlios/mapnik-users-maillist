<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Good evening, and thanks again for your replies. I wanted to do some
research before replying again, so I include here my interpretation of each
of your ideas. I'll start with the ideas that Robert Coup kindly shared. I'd
appreciate if you could tell me if I misunderstood something:

As I understand, based on the discussion thread 'Mapnik viewer and OSM
rendering' (
<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/mapnik-devel@lists.berlios.de/msg00096.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/mapnik-devel@lists.berlios.de/msg00096.html</A>),
there is an experimental branch developed by Ben Moores in which wxpdfdoc (
<A HREF="http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/wxpdfdoc/,">http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/wxpdfdoc/,</A> a c++ library for
creating PDF documents) is used to render maps on PDF documents and many of
the features mentioned below are already included.

Ideas from Robert Coup:
-----------------------------------

Port features from wxpdf (/branches/experimental-pdf/) to a Cairo-based PDF
renderer, including:

- Adding a border to the map to show coordinates: I interpret this as
displaying a frame around the map that shows the longitude and latitude
coordinates. The more the map is zoomed in, the more exact the coordinates
will be.

- Grids: I interpret this as displaying the longitude and latitude lines
over the map.

- Scale bars: Display the chart that shows the scale of the map graphically
(<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_scale">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_scale</A>).

- Overlay images, including other PDFs: Does the 'overlay' concept have the
same meaning as in Google Maps? According to Google Maps' documentation, an
overlay is an object attached to a coordinate, like the markers used to
point to places (
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapplets/overlays.html#Markers">http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/mapplets/overlays.html#Markers</A>).
If this is true, then this feature is about displaying these overlay images
on the exact points indicated by the associated coordinates (considering
that the units used for displaying on the screen and printing on a document
are different, am I right?). I'm not sure if I understand the part
'including other PDFs', though.

- Paper sizes/scale calculations: I read that images are displayed on paper
based on DPI units, so some calculations are needed to scale the maps to fit
different paper sizes. Tom Hughes mentions in the same thread that there are
some issues that need to be considered when tranlating the units used by
Mapnik and those of Cairo.

- Map layers as PDF layers: According to what I read, the objects displayed
on a PDF page can be organized in layers, which can be hidden. As a map is
rendered in layers, whose order is defined by a Mapnik configuration file (
<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/XMLConfigReference">http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/XMLConfigReference</A>), a PDF layer may be mapped
to a map layer. Hiding a PDF layer in a PDF viewer should cause the 'status'
attribute of the corresponding map layer to be set to OFF, causing it not be
rendered.

Finally, I read that Tom Hughes wrote a Cairo-based renderer, but I would
like to ask you if these features are already covered by it.

I'll do some research before replying to Mr. Pavlenko's and Mr. Marquardt
ideas. There's also an idea from Ben Moores about automatic legend
generation; is it related to what you say about legends, Mr. Marquardt?

Thanks,

Carlos L&#243;pez

&gt;<i> Hi Carlos,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2010/3/21 Carlos Enrique L&#243;pez Garc&#233;s &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-users">ccaarlooss at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good evening Mapnik community,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been searching for information about the 'Better Print Support'
</I>&gt;<i> project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea and I was wondiering if anyone could tell me how to contact Tom
</I>&gt;<i> Carden.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; He submitted the project idea, so I thought it would be a good idea to
</I>&gt;<i> ask
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; him about it. Any suggestions will be really appreciated. Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's also worth having a look at the code on the (abandoned) wxpdf
</I>&gt;<i> branch. See this post (and others by Ben) to have a look:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/mapnik-devel@lists.berlios.de/msg00140.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/mapnik-devel@lists.berlios.de/msg00140.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it has/had some cool features which could be worth porting to a
</I>&gt;<i> Cairo-based PDF renderer.
</I>&gt;<i>  * paper sizes/scale calculations
</I>&gt;<i>  * grids/graticules
</I>&gt;<i>  * overlay images, including other PDFs
</I>&gt;<i>  * scale bars
</I>&gt;<i>  * borders around the map, with coordinates
</I>&gt;<i>  * outputting map layers as true PDF layers. This allows turning on &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> off individual layers in a PDF viewer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The addition of SVG symbol support makes things more scalable too...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rob :)
