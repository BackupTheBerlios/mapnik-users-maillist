<PRE>Good evening Mr. Pavlenko

Here's what I understand about your ideas:

There are currently two main renderers, one based on Cairo and the other on
AGG. The idea is to develop a third one that would not use this kind of
graphics libraries, but rather use SVG as output. Two main concerns drive
this initiative: Performance and scalability.

Concern #1: Performance. In your first reply to this thread, you mention
that the Cairo-based renderer is kind of slow, so an SVG output generator
using Boost.Spirit.Karma would be considerably faster. I read that both
Cairo and AGG are able to do it, but Spirit would increase performance,
right?

Concern #2: Scalability. Since the main virtue of SVG is that of making the
image scalable, this feature would be relatively straightforward to
implement. Furthermore, SVG is a common format, widely used by many
applications (Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator, for instance).

About the implementation, I understand that agg_renderer and cairo_renderer
are subclasses of feature_style_processor. This class does the basic
processing of the map, iterating over its defined layers and rules. The
subclasses (cairo_renderer and agg_renderer) are responsible of defining the
way each symbolizer is rendered, using each a different API (Cairo and AGG,
respectively). The svg_renderer would be based on Spirit to produce the
image in XML format.

I haven't read about how an SVG image can be embedded in a PDF file. My
question is, would this require the implementation of a separate PDF
renderer for SVG, just as Robert Coup says about a Cairo-based one?

Thanks,

Carlos Enrique L&#243;pez Garc&#233;s

&gt;<i> Hi Carlos,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your research!
</I>&gt;<i> (replying inline re: svg_renderer)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Ticket #320 (SVG-Based Symbolizers): I don't have enough information to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; comment here, but Mr. Pavlenko said he is interested in an SVG renderer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, this one is hard and my feeling is that it is not within the scope
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GSOC, but I'd be happy to be wrong. The main functionality here is
</I>&gt;<i> already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented, but the Mapnik developers need to discuss further about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach. I think that Artem is interested in using the more basic
</I>&gt;<i> support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inside AGG for reading/rendering SVG instead/in addition to RSVG, but we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should hear more from him.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I think his idea for an SVG renderer is different. #320 is about
</I>&gt;<i> being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to read/render SVG symbols and I think what an 'svg_renderer.cpp'
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be about is writing a new output renderer that would be very good at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authoring SVG (better than Cairo). This could be very very useful for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nicholas and others than desire optimal SVG output for post-processing. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think Nicholas used the PDF output in the past over SVG because Cairo's
</I>&gt;<i> PDF
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; output is slightly better supported than SVG, though SVG may be more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; desirable/flexibly for post-processing in general.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dane, you're right I was thinking about svg_renderer which would
</I>&gt;<i> extend feature_style_processor e.g
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> struct svg_renderer : feature_style_processor&lt;svg_renderer&gt; {}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and would render to SVG file. There are some nice features we can add
</I>&gt;<i> like  - simplifications, smoothing etc. Perhaps different policies to
</I>&gt;<i> control how SVG elements constructed, layering, embedded
</I>&gt;<i> fonts/symbols.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it would be possible to load and edit such SVG in popular apps
</I>&gt;<i> like Illustrator, Inkscape. Implementation can be based on existing
</I>&gt;<i> agg and cairo renderers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thinking more about SVG based symbols, I reckon it would be feasible
</I>&gt;<i> to implement this over summer. I can certainly provide guidance and
</I>&gt;<i> help on this one. I just now modified svg_test which comes with agg2.4
</I>&gt;<i> ( adding css color parsing from mapnik) and I was able to display
</I>&gt;<i> demo.svg (generated with rundemo.py). Most building blocks are already
</I>&gt;<i> there. For I/O we can re-use existing XML parsing framework (mapnik)
</I>&gt;<i> and add fast spirit based parser for &lt;path .../&gt; elements for example.
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like fun to me;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Artem
</I>&gt;<i>
