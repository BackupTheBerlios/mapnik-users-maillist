<PRE>Dear Mapnik Community,

Our team is working on an Mac Mini-based touchscreen mapping application 
for a Canadian museum.  We're looking for a Mapnik expert - preferably 
someone experienced with OS X/Cocoa/XCode - to help us.  This is a 
short-term telecommute position.  Some details:

- The desktop application needs to be standalone (local map tiles)
- Visitors drag pins to locations on the map.  As one zooms out,
   pins are aggregated into clusters (could be based on proximity or
   by geographic location - e.g., all pins in Germany grouped)
- Two instances of this application are running, sharing database
   of pin locations (and associated data)
- The app is still at a wireframe mockup stage.  We need to have
   a functioning alpha by the end of the month, beta by the end of
   July.
- Our team is variously located in Canada, Czech Republic,
   Greece and the USA.  There is a hardware testbed in the museum
   with remote VPN access and pan-tilt-zoom video cameras.  You can
   work from anywhere, at times that suits your schedule.
- We use git for source control, Campfire for group chat,
   basecamp for project management, Skype for voice calls.  A Jenkins
   server helps us with continuous integration.

If this job interests you, please send me an email 
(<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-users">darran at edmstudio.com</A>) with
    - your hourly rate
    - your availability for June and July (and perhaps August)
    - your experience with Mapnik and OS X-based development

Cheers,
Darran

P.S.  Sincere apologies if this message is considered inappropriate for 
the Mapnik user mail-list.  I looked at the list archives and 
description but couldn't see anything barring job postings.
