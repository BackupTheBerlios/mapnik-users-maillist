<PRE>Hi Darran,

Is it feasible for your app just to use a static cache of local map tiles (for the base map), and then draw pins/markers on top of them?

If so, Mapnik could be useful for generating that set of tiles. But for dynamically drawing a few pins (and clustering) it might be easier just use the OSX native Cocoa drawing apis. So you might not even need to include Mapnik in your application.

But, if you do, and you find someone to help out, feel free to shoot more emails to this list with any questions. For example, I provide OSX installers for Mapnik but currently they require installation in /Library/Frameworks/Mapnik.Framework for things to work properly. It would not be terribly hard, however, to provide a Mapnik package that could be used in an app bundle.

</I>&gt;<i> Our team is working on an Mac Mini-based touchscreen mapping application for a Canadian museum.  We're looking for a Mapnik expert - preferably someone experienced with OS X/Cocoa/XCode - to help us.  This is a short-term telecommute position.  Some details:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The desktop application needs to be standalone (local map tiles)
</I>&gt;<i> - Visitors drag pins to locations on the map.  As one zooms out,
</I>&gt;<i>  pins are aggregated into clusters (could be based on proximity or
</I>&gt;<i>  by geographic location - e.g., all pins in Germany grouped)
</I>&gt;<i> - Two instances of this application are running, sharing database
</I>&gt;<i>  of pin locations (and associated data)
</I>&gt;<i> - The app is still at a wireframe mockup stage.  We need to have
</I>&gt;<i>  a functioning alpha by the end of the month, beta by the end of
</I>&gt;<i>  July.
</I>&gt;<i> - Our team is variously located in Canada, Czech Republic,
</I>&gt;<i>  Greece and the USA.  There is a hardware testbed in the museum
</I>&gt;<i>  with remote VPN access and pan-tilt-zoom video cameras.  You can
</I>&gt;<i>  work from anywhere, at times that suits your schedule.
</I>&gt;<i> - We use git for source control, Campfire for group chat,
</I>&gt;<i>  basecamp for project management, Skype for voice calls.  A Jenkins
</I>&gt;<i>  server helps us with continuous integration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this job interests you, please send me an email (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-users">darran at edmstudio.com</A>) with
</I>&gt;<i>   - your hourly rate
</I>&gt;<i>   - your availability for June and July (and perhaps August)
</I>&gt;<i>   - your experience with Mapnik and OS X-based development
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> P.S.  Sincere apologies if this message is considered inappropriate for the Mapnik user mail-list.  I looked at the list archives and description but couldn't see anything barring job postings.
