<PRE>Hi Dane,

Yes, a static cache is certainly possible.  Our basemaps are not overlay 
detailed (no roads, for example), and we only need to let the visitor 
zoom in to about 20km across the viewing window.  We might start though 
by generating the maps dynamically.  Re the pins, yes, we've done a 
technical spike where these are drawn using native Cocoa.

&gt;<i> But, if you do, and you find someone to help out, feel free to shoot

</I>
Thanks to this list, we've got a very good Mapnik guy working with us. 
He would be well known to you all - but I'll leave it to him to reveal 
himself if he so desires.

Cheers,
Darran
