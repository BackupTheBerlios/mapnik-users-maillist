<PRE>Thanks Dane. I have no reason to believe it won't work on Linux as
it's quite straightforward C++. I have yet to try it though. The PHP
build infrastructure takes care of building extensions, it's a matter
of setting up a few (I think) m4 macros to link in the correct
libraries. I have made my own Visual Studio-based build system for
some extra flexibility, ease of use from within VS and to learn the
details of the dependencies, but the preferred way forward (for
deployment/distribution) is to integrate it with the PHP build system
like other extensions.

I haven't had much time lately though as my first daughter was born
last Thursday. Things are starting to settle down now so I hope to
have an hour left and right again over the next couple of weeks to
flesh out the remaining objects to wrap. After that I'll set up an
easier to use build system, focusing on Linux I think because the
majority of use cases will be on Linux (I have a project idea that
would require deployment on Linux so I have an incentive to get this
working). I'll report back.

I also have a question: as I'm pouring over the API, I'm coming across
a number of oddities that (I think) would be nice to fix in 2.0. It's
things like inconsistent naming, functions that are 'missing' (for
example there are ways to get complete collections of objects in some
places and only item by item in others), inconsistent use of
shared_ptr etc. I haven't investigated in how far those have been
addressed in 2.0. Has there been any work on this? I'm keeping track
of them as I find them, would you like me to post or is API stability
very important for 2.0 and will there only be function name changes
when really necessary?

cheers,

roel
