<PRE>Hi Lennard,

Thanks for your comments and please find our feedback below if you could.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That relation[2] is only one of the many huge natural=wood areas that were
</I>&gt;<i> added to Japan, as part of an import. They are all imported as insanely
</I>&gt;<i> large multipolygon relations. For instance, that relation 1337942 was
</I>&gt;<i> added 23 December 2010. Others might already have been imported before the
</I>&gt;<i> data of your local planet or extract.
</I>We tried to delete from planet_osm_polygon where osm_id=-1337942; and the deleted record is 0.

&gt;<i> What you could try now is find the rules in the stylesheet that relate to
</I>&gt;<i> natural=wood, and disable those. Also find the related SQL queries in the
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;Layer&gt; and modify them so they're explicitly *not* fetching natural=wood
</I>&gt;<i> from the database. You have to be very sure these large objects are not
</I>&gt;<i> fetched from the database[3].
</I>In osm.xml, we deleted the natural=wood and deleted wood in SQL and tried again but the speed didn't change. Now we are trying to do check the bottleneck.

Regards,

-Jin
