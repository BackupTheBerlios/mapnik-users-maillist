I know, you said so last time. There are more large natural=wood 
imported areas in Japan.

Ok, for all three layers, right?

What you could do now is set up SQL query logging, so you can determine 
if you're spending most of your time waiting for SQL or processing the 
returned geometries in mapnik. Additionally, you can compile mapnik with 
DEBUG and log the result of that. That will identify the layers, rules, 
and styles that take the most time.
