&gt;<i> Dear all,

</I>&gt;<i> This is Jin Kangfrom Rainbow. We are currently do Japanese map rendering up to zoom level 16 using hosting service like Slicehost. On average, it takes 7 mins to render for one tile and for level 10, it only takes 1 sec for 1 tile. Seems like the rendering speed got much slower if it goes to more than level 10. We might be doing something wrong and in current speed we are expecting 1-2 month to render all map of Japan. For your information, below is current server status.

</I>&gt;<i> We are struggling for several month for this rendering but still the rendering speed is too slow. We followed several comments from community but still not getting better. If you have any suggestion or idea from you experience, it will help us.

I am no expert, but this is what I would do. First try and find out
what part of the rendering process is taking the time. Is it the
actual render, or is it reading the data? With a little project that I
was doing, I found that I had to add some constraints in my select
statements so that it would ignore all the data that was not part of
the current view. This made it much faster. If you find your database
is the bottleneck, maybe you could do something similar.
