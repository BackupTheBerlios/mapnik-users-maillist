<PRE>Hello Liz,

Welcome to Mapnik.

Right, sounds good. We've not added support for a shapefile TILEINDEX  
(and there are currently no active plans to do so) because most use  
cases like this with Mapnik are handled nicely by PostGIS.

For reference however, Mapnik does support QuadTree indexes on  
shapefiles like those produced by 'shptree'. These files have  
an .index file extension and can be created by installing (done by  
default) the 'shapeindex' command line tool bundled with Mapnik and  
running it on a shapefile.

&gt;<i> and doing the spatial indexing with it, but I'm a total newbie with  
</I>&gt;<i> databases.
</I>
Ah, PostGIS is excellent, and there are a lot of resources for  
community and commercial support. Also, the PostGIS documentation has  
been improving rapidly in the last several months and you can find  
descriptions of working with spatial and attribute indexes here:

<A HREF="http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/manual-svn/ch04.html#id2767631">http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/manual-svn/ch04.html#id2767631</A>

&gt;<i> I think that a database view might take the place of the tile index  
</I>&gt;<i> file, but I don't know how to set it up.  Anybody have some  
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions about how this could be done?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I would start by importing your shapefiles into a single PostGIS table  
(don't worry about VIEW for now), and creating good spatial indexes  
and attribute indexes on any fields you plan to apply attribute  
filters upon.

Once you have benchmarked this approach you could break your tables up  
a bit and set manual extents for each table in your Mapnik XML which  
may be able to speed things up as well.

To help further it would be good to know your anticipated rendering  
workflow. You must be planning to render map tiles dynamically? Is  
your data frequently changing? If your data is fairly static, surely  
the easiest way of optimizing response times is to implement tile  
caching.


&gt;<i> Thanks,

Cheers,

Dane
