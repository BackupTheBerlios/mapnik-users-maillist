Can you provide a copy of your style file?

&gt;<i> What are the exact rules osm2pgsql uses in this case?
</I>
Generally it will convert a closed way into a polygon if it has a tag
which is marked as &quot;polygon&quot; in the style file. This does not appear to
be the case for any of the current tags, these are the entries in the
default.style:

node,way   highway      text         linear
node,way   name         text         linear
node,way   ref          text         linear
node,way   junction     text         linear

if your style has any of those as polygon instead of linear then this
would trigger it.

There is another possibility that it is triggered by the route relation
containing this way (153309). It looks like this route is also a
completely closed ring and it might just be trying to interpret this
route as a multipolygon. I think this might have a side-effect of
converting the closed roundabout way into a polygon too.

The odd thing is that the main OSM site interprets the same data
correctly so I believe there must either be a difference in the style or
newer osm2pgsql version.
