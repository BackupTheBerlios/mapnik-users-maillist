<PRE>I don't think this is currently possible, but I'm interested in the 
possibility of using fonts to represent one way arrows. The application 
of this is to prevent arrows from overlapping with street labels and 
themselves.

Right now, I have one way arrow styles drawing from an image, which 
results in overlapping with street labels and overlapping of arrows.

oneway_style = Style()
oneway_rule_to = Rule()
oneway_rule_to.max_scale = 3000000000
oneway_rule_to.filter = Filter(&quot;[dir_travel] = 'a'&quot;)
oneway_line_symbolizer = 
LinePatternSymbolizer('/home/symbols/arrow4_120_4.png','png',120,4)
oneway_rule_to.symbols.append(oneway_line_symbolizer)
oneway_style.rules.append(oneway_rule_to)
oneway_rule_from = Rule()
oneway_rule_from.max_scale = 3000000000
oneway_rule_from.filter = Filter(&quot;[dir_travel] = '`'&quot;)
oneway_line_symbolizer = 
LinePatternSymbolizer('/home/symbols/arrow4_120_4_from.png','png',120,4)
oneway_rule_from.symbols.append(oneway_line_symbolizer)
oneway_style.rules.append(oneway_rule_from)
m.append_style('one way', oneway_style)

The arrows are drawn without consideration of where the street names are 
placed, and the images overlap each other and are sometimes cut off.

This is how it might work if drawing the one way arrows as text from a 
font file:

First, I've added an attribute dir_travel to my one way streets 
features. This contains the character each arrow symbol is mapped to in 
the Arrows font file ('a' = direction of travel is one way from 
referenced endpoint to non-referenced endpoint, '`' = direction of 
travel is one way from non-referenced endpoint to referenced endpoint). 
However, maybe there could be an option to define which font symbol to 
use when only one symbol(character) is used from a font library.

oneway_style = Style()
oneway_rule = Rule()
# Here, if dir_travel = 'a' the font symbol mapped to the lower case a 
character is used (right arrow).
# If dir_travel = '`' the font symbol mapped to the grave accent 
character is used (left arrow).
oneway_arrow_symbolizer = TextSymbolizer('dir_travel','Arrows 
Regular',7, Color('blue'))
# Or, here's how a new SymbolSymbolizer could work if just using one symbol
oneway_symbol_symbolizer = SymbolSymbolizer('a','Arrows Regular',7, 
Color('blue'))
oneway_arrow_symbolizer.label_placement = label_placement.LINE_PLACEMENT
# Here's where a new label_orientation option could be implemented which 
would align the label to the direction of the line.
# (default label_orientation would be oriented to the page)
oneway_arrow_symbolizer.label_orientation = line
oneway_arrow_symbolizer.label_spacing = 30
oneway_arrow_symbolizer.avoid_edges = 30
oneway_arrow_symbolizer.minimum_distance = 30
oneway_rule.symbols.append(oneway_arrow_symbolizer)

Would this be something difficult to implement?
