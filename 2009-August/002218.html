<PRE>Hi dane,

I tried the python-lxml package and I get the same freeze up. In standalone,
my WMS client can GetCapabilities fine and render my requests (even with
lxml installed).  I remove lxml and server works well (You can pass a getMap
request and it responds okay). I reinstall and the same freeze. This leads
me to believe, this might a bug from somewhere? Right?

 

By the way, what other WMS solutions do you use now with Mapnik as base that
bypasses the problem?

 

Thanks

Jome

P.S IS there a way I can get the standalone process to run even when I close
my console (I'm using a virtual server which I access remotely. When I
logout the process ends.)

Hello all.

I was silent about this for a while as I felt I was becoming much of a
bother. But this is what I have observed with my server.

I'm using Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid.

I installed mapnik and configured (much with Dane's help) and my first
problem (well. not really the first) was that I could get the server to run
(not standalone) but my WMS client could not get capabilities which is
possible standalone.

 

Oh? the capabilities did not work when run in WSGI Standalone mode? Are you
sure? I think I may have missed this problem in your previous emails...

 

Perhaps it was because the WSGI standalone was mounting at port 8000 or
8080, not port 80. It is possible to mount on port 80 if you stop apache and
then have the standalone server attach to 0.0.0.0:80.

 

I felt it had to do with some xml parsing problem.

 

Hmm, possibly the built in xml libraries (used if lxml is not present) do
not support namespacing correctly. Shoot, I didn't realize this issue
previously.

 

Overall however, it seems like nicemap should still be able to read the
response...





After some research I realized I needed some dependencies, particularly lxml
and libxslt. I go ahead and install them and everything remains fine in
standalone. However when I run the service from apache, the whole thing
freezes.

 

 

Yes I have seen this with lxml/libxslt...

 

On osx I have never been able to get lxml python bindings working with an
long-running server process (I may not have been able to get it work in
standard cgi either- can't recall).

 

I experienced crashing, and that was one of the motivations for allow for
fallback support in the OGCServer, such that if lxml is not installed it
will use the built-in xml python libraries:

 

<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/1085/trunk/bindings/python/mapnik/ogcserver">http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/1085/trunk/bindings/python/mapnik/ogcserver</A>
/common.py





Okay, I rebuilt the server 

 

you mean mapnik? the server is just python code and is not built at all,
just copied to your site-packages directory....





and configured without lxml and libxslt and the service runs within apache.
I install those two dependencies and they have seemingly frozen apache
again. It will only work standalone.

I installed lxml using easy_install. That's when the server worked last!

 

You could try installing it with apt-get.





Any ideas what could be wrong here?

 

Sounds like:

1) not using lxml messed up the servers namespacing in the GetCaps response

2) lxml used within apache can result in crashing for unknown reasons

3) the standalone wsgi server may or may not introduce other variables into
this mix
