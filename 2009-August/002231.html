It's not a bug, but it needs some actions on your part.

When mapnik renders a tile, it doesn't know, and actually doesn't care 
as much, about anything that goes on in neighbouring tiles. So, 
different placement/rendering decisions can be taken in neighbouring tiles.

The common ways to reduce what you are seeing is to:

a) Render metatiles. Usually 8x8 tiles, which are then cut up into 64 
separate tiles. Rendering this many tiles in one go is almost guaranteed 
to be faster than 64 separate renders, as well.

But, doing 8x8 only moves these issues to the outside borders, where it 
can still occur.

The common solution is then to:

b) Render a gutter/buffer area around a tile. If you want a 256x256 
pixel tile, render a 512x512 pixel tile, and discard the outer 128px 
border, leaving you with a 256x256 tile, which probably has less of 
these issues. This works even better with metatiles, as the overhead is 
then substantially reduced.

Because b) takes some extra work on your part, a new option has been 
included in mapnik for a while now (I think since around 0.6.0) that can 
take care of this buffer area for you, leading to:

c) Add buffer_size=&quot;&lt;number&gt;&quot; to your &lt;Map&gt; definition. For &lt;number&gt;, 
128 (see above) is usually a suitable number, but you can experiment to 
see which buffer size works best for you.
