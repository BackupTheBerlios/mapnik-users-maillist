<PRE>Hi Jome

&gt;<i> Hi dane,

Interesting. And you are sure you uninstalled the one previously  
installed via easy_install ?

Also, how did you install libxml2? I assume that from apt would be the  
case and if so I have no other ideas on installation.

&gt;<i> In standalone, my WMS client can GetCapabilities fine and render my  
</I>&gt;<i> requests (even with lxml installed).
</I>
Oh, interesting.

That may mean that this is a race condition, ie that the requests are  
being made and either the OGCServer or libxml are not threadsafe.

In your WSGIDaemonProcess make sure you have threads=1

WSGIDaemonProcess wms user=jome group=jome processes=10 threads=1

You could also try reducing processes to 1, see if that makes any  
difference.


&gt;<i>  I remove lxml and server works well (You can pass a getMap request  
</I>&gt;<i> and it responds okay). I reinstall and the same freeze. This leads  
</I>&gt;<i> me to believe, this might a bug from somewhere? Right?
</I>
Ya, seems like it could be a bug in lxml, or perhaps mis-usage of lxml  
in the OGCServer.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, what other WMS solutions do you use now with Mapnik as  
</I>&gt;<i> base that bypasses the problem?
</I>
Don't know of any...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> Jome
</I>&gt;<i> P.S IS there a way I can get the standalone process to run even when  
</I>&gt;<i> I close my console (I&#8217;m using a virtual server which I access  
</I>&gt;<i> remotely. When I logout the process ends.)
</I>
Yes. You can install 'screen'

Do:

$ sudo apt-get installs screen
$ screen
... run your WSGI standalone
... close the terminal (don't type exit)

To get back to it ssh back in, then type:
$ screen -r
... you should be back in the console with the running server process

</I>&gt;<i> Hello all&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> I was silent about this for a while as I felt I was becoming much of

</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m using Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid.
</I>&gt;<i> I installed mapnik and configured (much with Dane&#8217;s help) and my  
</I>&gt;<i> first problem (well&#8230; not really the first) was that I could get the  
</I>&gt;<i> server to run (not standalone) but my WMS client could not get  
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities which is possible standalone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh? the capabilities did not work when run in WSGI Standalone mode?  
</I>&gt;<i> Are you sure? I think I may have missed this problem in your  
</I>&gt;<i> previous emails...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps it was because the WSGI standalone was mounting at port 8000  
</I>&gt;<i> or 8080, not port 80. It is possible to mount on port 80 if you stop  
</I>&gt;<i> apache and then have the standalone server attach to 0.0.0.0:80.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I felt it had to do with some xml parsing problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, possibly the built in xml libraries (used if lxml is not  
</I>&gt;<i> present) do not support namespacing correctly. Shoot, I didn't  
</I>&gt;<i> realize this issue previously.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Overall however, it seems like nicemap should still be able to read  
</I>&gt;<i> the response...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After some research I realized I needed some dependencies,  
</I>&gt;<i> particularly lxml and libxslt. I go ahead and install them and  
</I>&gt;<i> everything remains fine in standalone. However when I run the  
</I>&gt;<i> service from apache, the whole thing freezes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes I have seen this with lxml/libxslt...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On osx I have never been able to get lxml python bindings working  
</I>&gt;<i> with an long-running server process (I may not have been able to get  
</I>&gt;<i> it work in standard cgi either- can't recall).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I experienced crashing, and that was one of the motivations for  
</I>&gt;<i> allow for fallback support in the OGCServer, such that if lxml is  
</I>&gt;<i> not installed it will use the built-in xml python libraries:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/1085/trunk/bindings/python/mapnik/ogcserver/common.py">http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/1085/trunk/bindings/python/mapnik/ogcserver/common.py</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I rebuilt the server
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you mean mapnik? the server is just python code and is not built at  
</I>&gt;<i> all, just copied to your site-packages directory....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and configured without lxml and libxslt and the service runs within  
</I>&gt;<i> apache. I install those two dependencies and they have seemingly  
</I>&gt;<i> frozen apache again. It will only work standalone.
</I>&gt;<i> I installed lxml using easy_install. That&#8217;s when the server worked  
</I>&gt;<i> last!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could try installing it with apt-get.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas what could be wrong here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) not using lxml messed up the servers namespacing in the GetCaps  
</I>&gt;<i> response
</I>&gt;<i> 2) lxml used within apache can result in crashing for unknown reasons
</I>&gt;<i> 3) the standalone wsgi server may or may not introduce other  
</I>&gt;<i> variables into this mix
