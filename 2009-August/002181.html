<PRE>Hello Dane,

Thanks again. Some more questions.

1.       Mod_wsgi. Is this a module I must download and install or is it
already present within my installation? The documentation you pointed me to
only seems to talk about configuration with the assumption that mod_wsgi
already exists within the installation.

2.       When my WMS client talked to the server, it sent a GetCapabilities
request to the server and was expecting such things as CRS projection,
Layers etc. How do I get my server to report these capabilities (and have
these capabilities as well?)

 

 

Thanks.

Jome.

Hello one more time Dane.

Looks like I'm on a roll here. Many thanks for the tips and insight you gave
me. I ran the url request below against the standalone server at port 8000
like this . <A HREF="http://greenstreamsa.com:8000/wms.py?width=1024">http://greenstreamsa.com:8000/wms.py?width=1024</A>

And I got an image! Not sure I've felt like this since high school. MY
curiousity's heightening by the sec.

 

 

Cool, it looks like that errors out because the layer 'world' does not exist
in your mapfile. I'm not sure what the layer is called in your mapfile so I
changed it to grab all layers ('__all__'):

What I need to know now is this

1.       How do I set the wms.py to accept the parameters the string passes
to generate the appropriate image.

 

It automatically accepts what the WMS spec allows. If you want to pass
custom parameters then you'll be needing to code that yourself.





At the moment my map factory is &quot;linked&quot; to an xml file and no matter what I
adjust in the request (the parameters) I still get the same image.

 

 

Right, you determine the xml file that your server is able to serve by
changing the ogcserver.conf to point to a different map_factory.py.
Currently there is not support for reading in more than one xml mapfile.





2.       How do I get the server to run without being &quot;standalone&quot;?

 

Just install mod_wsgi within apache and point it at the script you created
for the standalone server. mod_wsgi will look for the 'application' variable
in the script and launch a long running process:

Hello again Dane.

Looks like I got the standalone WSGI server working!!! Phew!!! Now  I know
my installation works? What do I have to do for the server to respond to
requests like this?

Many Many thanks.

Hello Jome,

 

Glad you are excited about getting started. Sounds like you've made some
great progress so far.

 

Sorry about the lack of step by step documentation for WMS.  If you continue
to post places you get stuck we can surely provide tips as you go along. You
might also consider stopping by the #mapnik room on irc.freenode.net.

 

As far as the problem you describe below: Can you say a bit more about how
you are making the Http request? What is the full URL/Query String? Usually
one would use a client like OpenLayers to automatically create the request
once the server is set up properly. To confirm the server is set up you
should simply be able to go to the url where you have exposed it without
providing any query string and you'll get a welcome message like this:

 

<A HREF="http://wms.dbsgeo.com/">http://wms.dbsgeo.com/</A>

 

If you are not yet using the Firebug extension to Mozilla Firefox that is a
great way of debugging requests and responses, once you start adding layer
and other parameters.

 

Also, when I am configuring the WMS server I always first run in 'WSGI'
Standalone mode so that I don't have to dig through apache logs to figure
out potential configuration problems. Using the standalone WSGI setup as a
development server launched in a terminal process all errors simply print to
the screen.

 

See: <A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/OgcServer#SampleConfigurations">http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/OgcServer#SampleConfigurations</A>

 

Hope that helps. Feel free to shoot more questions as you have them.

 

Dane

Hello,

Please let me establish a baseline before I proceed. I got excited about
Mapnik when I saw what it could achieve via the Drupal WMS client, Nice Map.
I decided to build my own WMS server for my Drupal websites and I think I've
gotten way over my head on this. I've no experience in python (but that has
been fast changing in the last few days) but I managed to get Mapnik
installed on my server (running Ubuntu 8.10) and followed the available
tutorials on creating first maps and I think I passed that hurdle so far.

However, where I get stumped is when I make an http request for a map (much
like what the Nice map Drupal module would do) and nothing just happens.

I've searched and scoured through sites looking for any good tutorials that
could help an enthusiastic newbie like me get off the ground with even the
simplest of external map requests. Can anyone help out or point me to good
enough documentation that us mere mortals can follow?

Many thanks.
