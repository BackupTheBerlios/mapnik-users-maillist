Oh? the capabilities did not work when run in WSGI Standalone mode?  
Are you sure? I think I may have missed this problem in your previous  
emails...

Perhaps it was because the WSGI standalone was mounting at port 8000  
or 8080, not port 80. It is possible to mount on port 80 if you stop  
apache and then have the standalone server attach to 0.0.0.0:80.

&gt;<i> I felt it had to do with some xml parsing problem.
</I>
Hmm, possibly the built in xml libraries (used if lxml is not present)  
do not support namespacing correctly. Shoot, I didn't realize this  
issue previously.

Overall however, it seems like nicemap should still be able to read  
the response...

</I>

Yes I have seen this with lxml/libxslt...

On osx I have never been able to get lxml python bindings working with  
an long-running server process (I may not have been able to get it  
work in standard cgi either- can't recall).

I experienced crashing, and that was one of the motivations for allow  
for fallback support in the OGCServer, such that if lxml is not  
installed it will use the built-in xml python libraries:

<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/1085/trunk/bindings/python/mapnik/ogcserver/common.py">http://trac.mapnik.org/changeset/1085/trunk/bindings/python/mapnik/ogcserver/common.py</A>

&gt;<i> Okay, I rebuilt the server
</I>
you mean mapnik? the server is just python code and is not built at  
all, just copied to your site-packages directory....

&gt;<i> and configured without lxml and libxslt and the service runs within  
</I>&gt;<i> apache. I install those two dependencies and they have seemingly  
</I>&gt;<i> frozen apache again. It will only work standalone.
</I>&gt;<i> I installed lxml using easy_install. That&#8217;s when the server worked  
</I>&gt;<i> last!
</I>
You could try installing it with apt-get.

&gt;<i> Any ideas what could be wrong here?
</I>
Sounds like:
1) not using lxml messed up the servers namespacing in the GetCaps  
response
2) lxml used within apache can result in crashing for unknown reasons
3) the standalone wsgi server may or may not introduce other variables  
into this mix
