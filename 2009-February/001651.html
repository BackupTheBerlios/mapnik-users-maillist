<PRE>Hi again

After seeing hill shading in action, I did some research too in this
matter. I based my work on:
<A HREF="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/HikingBikingMaps">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/HikingBikingMaps</A>
and again came across some issues with Mapnik.

Mapnik problems:
- very basic support for rasters, no opacity, no advanced merging, only
replacing already drawn background.
- no raster scaling, only nearest neighbor. I need scaling up to 64x
(12-18 zoom level) and mapnik generated only big squares
- despite my last patch, 256 color palette was still bad for slow
gradients like shading.

I corrected, in some degree, all of above limits, and want
to share with You.

Here are some examples of my work in action:

I use SRTM-3 v2:
<A HREF="ftp://e0srp01u.ecs.nasa.gov/srtm/version2/SRTM30/">ftp://e0srp01u.ecs.nasa.gov/srtm/version2/SRTM30/</A>
converted to mercator projection (gdal) avoiding elipsoid-&gt;spheroid
reprojection (only latlon-&gt;mercator) with pixel size: 76.437 x 76.437 m.
Based on srtm-3 resolution, it should be 90x90, but alignment to output
resolution was needed. 76.437 is closest number to 90 from
(2*pi*6378137)/2^n set.
For Poland, this gives 16000x14000 GeoTIFF in resolution aligned
to zoom 11. I made scaled copies 50% and 25% for lower zooms, to
increase speed and avoid downscaling. I could do the same to avoid
upscaling, but already it is 250MB file, and each zoom would make it 4x
bigger then previous.


Patches are in attachment (hopefully this time :) ), here I will
describe in short, what is changed, and what can be done more.

1) Raster opacity

Added opacity handling using existing methods. It isn't needed
for shading, but can be useful. To enable opacity, add css style opacity
to RasterSymbolizer. It works both for cairo and internal agg renderer.

2) Raster merging

Added some basic merging methods. I use for hill shading which is gimp
like &quot;merge grain&quot;:
<A HREF="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-concepts-layer-modes.html#id2834930">http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-concepts-layer-modes.html#id2834930</A>
Default is normal mode, to select differently, set css &quot;mode&quot; to
desired value. Available modes based on given link:
- grain_merge : bg + fg - 0.5
- grain_merge2 : bg + fg*2 - 1.0
- multiply : fg * bg
- multiply2 : fg * bg * 2.0
- divide : bg / fg
- divide2 : bg * 2.0 / fg
- screen : 1 - (1-fg)(1-g)
- hard_light : ..... (look ad link above)

Agg renderer have some similar code in
agg/include/agg_pixfmt_rgba.h
but I didn't use it. I wrote my code based on existing part for alpha
blending from mapnik/include/mapnik/graphics.hpp.
This fix works only with agg renderer, I couldn't find appropriate way
to implement it using Cairo. I googled and found some references to
filters for ie. hard light, but no documentation or examples, and I'm
not sure if it exists in cairo.
This fix and previous probably handle:
<A HREF="http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/157">http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/157</A>
if someone could implement it also in cairo, or at least show me right
direction.

3) Raster scaling

Added bilinear scaling algorithm. Algorithm can be selected with css
&quot;scaling&quot; parameter and available values are:
- fast : nearest neighbor as it was already
- bilinear : new bilinear interpolation for all 4 chanels (RGBA)
- bilinear8 : as bilinear, but only one channel assumed. This probably
needs some fix, as it doesn't handle alfa. I added it to speedup in my
case, where raster is grayscale without transparency.

Scaling in cairo renderer could be reimplemented using matrix, but I use
mapnik-0.5.1 with my patches, so basically I concentrated on
agg renderer.

4) 256 color palette optimizations

My previous patch removed obvious bug in octree. Still, generated
palette is not enough for hill shading. It looks more like 50 colors,
then 256. The problem is with prunning only on lowest level, so all left
leafs are almost on the same level. It is similar to dividing to even
ranges, regardless of density. My patch prunes only branches with lowest
pixel count from all levels, so subtrees with many leafs, remain deeper,
then one with smaller sample count.

Some limiting was needed, to allow colors with small sample count to
remain unharmed (ie, some distinctive feature on map with not enough
pixels, to &quot;fight&quot; with gradients should be preserved).
I didn't find any significant increase in processing time, and
only 5-10% increase in size (due to more significant colors). Effects
are almost as good, as optimal palette without error-diffusion in
imagemagick or Gimp.

Still there are problem with color assignment, because quite often cube
for classified color doesn't have the best color. Neighbor cubes should
be compared, but traversing octree is fast, but not free. I made some
fix, to check siblings and neighbour cubes (going up and down the
three), but it increased processing time of quantization about 40% and
effects aren't so much worse without it. It isn't included in
attachment.



Example osm.xml fragment:
&lt;Style name=&quot;raster18&quot;&gt;
     &lt;Rule&gt;
         &lt;MaxScaleDenominator&gt;1000000&lt;/MaxScaleDenominator&gt;
         &lt;MinScaleDenominator&gt;250000&lt;/MinScaleDenominator&gt;
         &lt;RasterSymbolizer&gt;
             &lt;CssParameter name=&quot;opacity&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/CssParameter&gt;
             &lt;CssParameter name=&quot;scaling&quot;&gt;bilinear&lt;/CssParameter&gt;
             &lt;CssParameter name=&quot;mode&quot;&gt;grain_merge&lt;/CssParameter&gt;
         &lt;/RasterSymbolizer&gt;
     &lt;/Rule&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
&lt;Layer name=&quot;dem18&quot; status=&quot;on&quot; &gt;
     &lt;StyleName&gt;raster18&lt;/StyleName&gt;
     &lt;Datasource&gt;
         &lt;Parameter name=&quot;type&quot;&gt;gdal&lt;/Parameter&gt;
         &lt;Parameter name=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&geotiffs;/hill_15m.tif&lt;/Parameter&gt;
         &lt;Parameter name=&quot;format&quot;&gt;tiff&lt;/Parameter&gt;
     &lt;/Datasource&gt;
&lt;/Layer&gt;

Additional notes:

If scaling and tiling, there can be some problems with alignment if
raster resolution isn't integer multiply of output resolution and
rendered regions have margin, like in mod_tile:
A---------B---|---A-----------B
Because size and position of source raster bbox is averaged to pixel 
steps, error can be different on each edge and '|' in A image could be
displaced in B image. 0.5 pix in raster could mean 16px after 32x 
scaling (5 zoom steps) and this is noticeable even earlier.

I use raster in resolution of zoom 11, so scaling is power of 2 and any
errors are same on each rendered edge. In my case, mod_tile renders
in each zoom:  9*256 x 9*256 region. This is cut with 128 margin to 8x8
tiles, each 256x256 size. Everything is scaled by power of 2, and
everything is aligned.

It shouldn't(?) matter if we consider no margin tile joining:
A--------AB---------B.



Adding hill shading to my Mapnik using raster increased generation time
only about 2x (35tiles/s -&gt; 17 tiles/s).

In my case map is updated ~twice a week and only 300k are forced to
redraw and send to cache server.

I use self-patched mapnik 0.5.1 with some 3 months old version
of mod_tile for apache. Actually I have two mod_tile modules, to handle
two separate osm.xml and two databases, which I switch on update.

My osm.xml is divided to separate files defining layers, styles, db
settings etc. Styles are grouped by categories. In effect I have 22 xml
files that sum up to 420kB. Thank You for libxml2 features, or I would
go insane managing this in one osm.xml :)
