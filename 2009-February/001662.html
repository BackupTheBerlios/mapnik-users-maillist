<PRE>Hello all and thank you for allowing me to post. I spent a little time
on the IRC with these questions and some good information was returned
to me.

Here is my scenario ...

I have two sets of data that I am interested in with most likely two
separate projects.

1) I have collected data from the county I live in (Humphreys County,
Tennessee). I have used this data with JOSM to create the map that I
want. Following this, I used osm2pgsql to import the data into postgres
for mapnik to render. I selected a bounding box of the area I wanted
rendered with a scale of 10-18. (This took a little while.) But it has
completed.

2) I have shapefile data from the Army Corps of Engineers containing
data for the river system. An email asking about projection resulted in
the following statement:

&quot; ... The charts that are converted to ESRI shapefile
format are the same projection of the S-57 data:  Geographic projection
with
WGS84 spheroid and datum. ...&quot;

The line in the .prj file from the data I have downloaded reads ....

GEOGCS[&quot;GCS_WGS_1984&quot;,DATUM[&quot;D_WGS_1984&quot;,SPHEROID[&quot;WGS_1984&quot;,6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM[&quot;Greenwich&quot;,0.0],UNIT[&quot;Degree&quot;,0.0174532925199433]]

Now please remember, I am as green and new as you can get to this
activity, but here are my questions.

1) How can I include the shapefile in my PostGres database to be
rendered by Mapnik? Does it need to be done outside of the database?

2) When the tiles are rendered, is their a clear example of how to use
the rendered tiles with OpenLayers? Is TileCache required or optional? I
have no need to render on demand. (Maybe because ignorance is bliss)  :)

3) If someone is trying to learn all of these different software layers
to create maps, where does one go? Google does not seem to bring up a
lot of resources for newbies?

4) Is there a concise guide, FAQ, Tutorial that would explain the steps,
configurations, or link to information to get a new user involved and
ramped up the learning curve a bit? Or is this stuff really just
targeted towards cartographers or something?

Please don't get me wrong. I am willing to RTFM, but finding it seems to
be my problem. Can someone shed some light on it for me, please?

Warm Regards,

Joe
