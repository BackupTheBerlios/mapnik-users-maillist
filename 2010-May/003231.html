<PRE>Hello!

On Thu, 06 May 2010 22:15:19 +0200, Dane Springmeyer &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/mapnik-users">blake at hailmail.net</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> In addition, I'd also like to see you document and share a little more

</I>
As far as I've investigated it so far every click on the map sends a
request to Google's servers which contains the point the user clicked at
and returns information about the feature at this position (if any).
But they also send a list of all visible features, but without details.
I only looked at network transfers and I'd like to avoid looking at their
code as this might create potential legal issues.
One thing I've seen is that google places labels not always above a point
but sometimes also to the right or left.
Here is an example:
<A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=36.452734,73.388672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.517226,13.396111&amp;spn=0.006842,0.017917&amp;z=16">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=36.452734,73.388672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.517226,13.396111&amp;spn=0.006842,0.017917&amp;z=16</A>

I'll try to find such an area on
the map. It would provide a good example of what this project is about.

&gt;<i> It will also be good to give thought to how to expose these features in  
</I>&gt;<i> Mapnik's XML stylesheets, so that users can easily decide which layers  
</I>&gt;<i> (or perhaps even styles, if more than style pulls from a layer), are  
</I>&gt;<i> clickable, and with what metadata.
</I>
I'll try to find a good solution for this, but this can be defined later,  
when the other code is working and I have more experience how it might be  
used.

&gt;<i> Layer's currently have a queryable=&quot;&lt;bool&gt;&quot; parameter which is used to  
</I>&gt;<i> determine whether the feature should be able to be queried from a WMS  
</I>&gt;<i> server that supports GetFeatureInfo. Something similiar to that  
</I>&gt;<i> parameter may be in order.
</I>
I'll have a look at GetFeatureInfo.

&gt;<i> yes, yes..., or shift a line to the side  
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/180">https://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/180</A>) (though most utility will relate to  
</I>&gt;<i> point placement I assume).
</I>
There are some line feature which might be worth considering (e.g. famous
bridges, etc.)

&gt;&gt;<i> At the point during processing at which an object (line, polygon, text)  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is actually output to the final image the geometry data is captured  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together with an user definable object property (object ID, street  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name, &#8230;) and written to a metadata section. For more complex features  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> post processing might be required that combines features to reduce the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amount of data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, so right now I see this happening inside agg_renderer.cpp or  
</I>&gt;<i> cairo_renderer.cpp + placement_finder.cpp. Perhaps after getting  
</I>&gt;<i> metadata collection working within the actual renderer code, you could  
</I>&gt;<i> think about ways to make it more generic, perhaps through subclassing.  
</I>&gt;<i> Involving Artem Pavlenko in the question of how existing renderers might  
</I>&gt;<i> be extended/designed with this flexibility in mind will be important.
</I>
I try to understand the code a bit and then I'll discuss the way how to  
code this.

&gt;&gt;<i> - The project idea page in the wiki lists EXIF as a possible output  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> format. This might be well suited because all data is contained in one  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file, but it's hard to read EXIF data in JavaScript which is the main  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform for clickable maps. I was able to find only one JavaScript  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> EXIF implementation and it doesn't work in all browsers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, great ideas. They certainly all have benefits. I know the  
</I>&gt;<i> Javascript EXIF may not be compatible with IE, but is could be very  
</I>&gt;<i> slick in the future as support came online (I presume browsers  
</I>&gt;<i> supporting Canvas would also support JS libs that can parse EXIF  
</I>&gt;<i> directly from the image?)
</I>
I haven't found such a lib yet. The autor of the only library I know of  
writes &quot;So, there are two parts to the problem. First step is to get  
access to the raw binary data of the JPEG. Now, while it's easy to get to  
the pixel data using canvas, we don't get any of the data around the  
actual image, and that's where the interesting parts are hidden.&quot;  
(<A HREF="http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2008/05/reading-exif-data-with-javascript.html">http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2008/05/reading-exif-data-with-javascript.html</A>)

&gt;&gt;<i> Of course the implementation and output formats are open to suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. My tendency would be to start with sqlite, as a balance of  
</I>&gt;<i> efficiently and portability, but I am open to suggestions. Something  
</I>&gt;<i> that was file based and could be directly parsed by OpenLayers would  
</I>&gt;<i> also be very useful....
</I>
I think file based output would be the easiest solution because it can
be read by any text editor. (This helps debugging). When this works more  
formats can be added.
